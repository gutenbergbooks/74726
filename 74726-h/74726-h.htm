<p>With the signing of the Armistice on
November 11, 1918, the World War has been
practically brought to an end. The events
of the past four years have been of such
magnitude that the various steps, the numberless
battles, and the growth of Allied
power which led up to the final victory are
not clearly defined even in the minds of
many military men. A history of this great
period which will state in an orderly fashion
this series of events will be of the
greatest value to the future students of the
war, and to everyone of the present day who
desires to refer in exact terms to matters
which led up to the final conclusion.</p>

<p>The war will be discussed and re-discussed
from every angle and the sooner such
a compilation of facts is available, the
more valuable it will be. I understand that
this History of the World War intends to
put at the disposal of all who are interested,
such a compendium of facts of the
past period of over four years; and that the
system employed in safeguarding the accuracy
of statements contained in it will produce
a document of great historical value without
entering upon any speculative conclusions as
to cause and effect of the various phases of
the war or attempting to project into an
historical document individual opinions.
With these ends in view, this History will
be of the greatest value.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is a popular narrative history of the
world’s greatest war. Written frankly
from the viewpoint of the United States and
the Allies, it visualizes the bloodiest and
most destructive conflict of all the ages from
its remote causes to its glorious conclusion
and beneficent results. The world-shaking
rise of new democracies is set forth, and the
enormous national and individual sacrifices
producing that resurrection of human equality
are detailed.</p>

<p>Two ideals have been before us in the preparation
of this necessary work. These are
simplicity and thoroughness. It is of no
avail to describe the greatest of human events
if the description is so confused that the
reader loses interest. Thoroughness is an
historical essential beyond price. So it is that
official documents prepared in many instances
upon the field of battle, and others taken
from the files of the governments at war, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
the basis of this work. Maps and photographs
of unusual clearness and high authenticity
illuminate the text. All that has gone
into war making, into the regeneration of the
world, are herein set forth with historical
particularity. The stark horrors of Belgium,
the blighting terrors of chemical warfare, the
governmental restrictions placed upon hundreds
of millions of civilians, the war sacrifices
falling upon all the civilized peoples of
earth, are in these pages.</p>

<p>It is a work that mankind can well read and
treasure.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: The
armistice was signed this morning.
Everything for which America fought has been
accomplished. The war thus comes to an
end.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the Congress and the people
of the United States, President Wilson made
this declaration on November 11, 1918. A
few hours before he made this statement, Germany,
the empire of blood and iron, had agreed
to an armistice, terms of which were the hardest
and most humiliating ever imposed upon
a nation of the first class. It was the end of
a war for which Germany had prepared for
generations, a war bred of a philosophy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Might can take its toll of earth’s possessions,
of human lives and liberties, when and where
it will. That philosophy involved the cession
to imperial Germany of the best years of young
German manhood, the training of German
youths to be killers of men. It involved the
creation of a military caste, arrogant beyond
all precedent, a caste that set its strength and
pride against the righteousness of democracy,
against the possession of wealth and bodily
comforts, a caste that visualized itself as part
of a power-mad Kaiser’s assumption that he
and God were to shape the destinies of earth.</p>

<p>When Marshal Foch, the foremost strategist
in the world, representing the governments
of the Allies and the United States, delivered
to the emissaries of Germany terms upon which
they might surrender, he brought to an end
the bloodiest, the most destructive and the most
beneficent war the world has known. It is
worthy of note in this connection that the
three great wars in which the United States
of America engaged have been wars for freedom.
The Revolutionary War was for the
liberty of the colonies; the Civil War was
waged for the freedom of manhood and for
the principle of the indissolubility of the Union;
the World War, beginning 1914, was
fought for the right of small nations to self-government
and for the right of every country
to the free use of the high seas.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_002_2">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_002.jpg" alt="KINGS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THE PRINCIPAL

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">KINGS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THE PRINCIPAL
POWERS ASSOCIATED AGAINST THE GERMAN ALLIANCE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>More than four million American men were
under arms when the conflict ended. Of these,
more than two million were upon the fields of
France and Italy. These were thoroughly
trained in the military art. They had proved
their right to be considered among the most
formidable soldiers the world has known.
Against the brown rock of that host in khaki,
the flower of German savagery and courage
had broken at Château-Thierry. There the
high tide of Prussian militarism, after what
had seemed to be an irresistible dash for the
destruction of France, spent itself in the bloody
froth and spume of bitter defeat. There the
Prussian Guard encountered the Marines, the
Iron Division and the other heroic organizations
of America’s new army. There German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
soldiers who had been hardened and trained
under German conscription before the war,
and who had learned new arts in their bloody
trade, through their service in the World War,
met their masters in young Americans taken
from the shop, the field, and the forge, youths
who had been sent into battle with a scant six
months’ intensive training in the art of war.
Not only did these American soldiers hold the
German onslaught where it was but, in a sudden,
fierce, resistless counter-thrust they drove
back in defeat and confusion the Prussian
Guard, the Pommeranian Reserves, and
smashed the morale of that German division
beyond hope of resurrection.</p>

<p>The news of that exploit sped from the Alps
to the North Sea Coast, through all the camps
of the Allies, with incredible rapidity. “The
Americans have held the Germans. They can
fight,” ran the message. New life came into
the war-weary ranks of heroic poilus and into
the steel-hard armies of Great Britain. “The
Americans are as good as the best. There are
millions of them, and millions more are coming,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
was heard on every side. The transfusion
of American blood came as magic tonic,
and from that glorious day there was never
a doubt as to the speedy defeat of Germany.
From that day the German retreat dated.
The armistice signed on November 11, 1918,
was merely the period finishing the death sentence
of German militarism, the first word of
which was uttered at Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>Germany’s defiance to the world, her determination
to force her will and her “kultur”
upon the democracies of earth, produced the
conflict. She called to her aid three sister autocracies:
Turkey, a land ruled by the whims
of a long line of moody misanthropic monarchs;
Bulgaria, the traitor nation cast by its Teutonic
king into a war in which its people had
no choice and little sympathy; Austria-Hungary,
a congeries of races in which a Teutonic
minority ruled with an iron scepter.</p>

<p>Against this phalanx of autocracy, twenty-four
nations arrayed themselves. Populations
of these twenty-eight warring nations far exceeded
the total population of all the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of humanity. The conflagration of war
literally belted the earth. It consumed the
most civilized of capitals. It raged in the
swamps and forests of Africa. To its call
came alien peoples speaking words that none
but themselves could translate, wearing garments
of exotic cut and hue amid the smart
garbs and sober hues of modern civilization.
A twentieth century Babel came to the fields
of France for freedom’s sake, and there was
born an internationalism making for the future
understanding and peace of the world.

the World War and their populations

<p>Never before in the history of the world
were so many races and peoples mingled in
a military effort as those that came together
under the command of Marshal Foch. If we
divide the human races into white, yellow, red
and black, all four were largely represented.
Among the white races there were Frenchmen,
Italians, Portuguese, English, Scottish, Welsh,
Irish, Canadians, Australians, South Africans
(of both British and Dutch descent), New
Zealanders; in the American army, probably
every other European nation was represented,
with additional contingents from those already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
named, so that every branch of the white race
figured in the ethnological total.</p>

<p>There were representatives of many Asiatic
races, including not only the volunteers from
the native states of India, but elements from
the French colony in Cochin China, with Annam,
Cambodia, Tonkin, Laos, and Kwang
Chau Wan. England and France both contributed
many African tribes, including Arabs
from Algeria and Tunis, Senegalese, Saharans,
and many of the South African races.
The red races of North America were represented
in the armies of both Canada and the
United States, while the Maoris, Samoans, and
other Polynesian races were likewise represented.
And as, in the American Army, there
were men of German, Austrian, and Hungarian
descent, and, in all probability, contingents
also of Bulgarian and Turkish blood,
it may be said that Foch commanded an army
representing the whole human race, united in
defense of the ideals of the Allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_009">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="TERRITORIES OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIES">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">TERRITORIES OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIES UNDER THE
ARMISTICE OF NOVEMBER 11, 1918</p>

<p>Dotted area, invaded territory of Belgium, France, Luxembourg
and Alsace-Lorraine to be evacuated in fourteen days; area in small
squares, part of Germany west of the Rhine to be evacuated in twenty-five
days and occupied by Allied and U. S. troops; lightly shaded area
to east of Rhine, neutral zone; black semi-circles, bridge-heads of
thirty kilometers radius in the neutral zone to be occupied by Allied
armies.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It will be seen that more than ten times the
number of neutral persons were engulfed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the maelstrom of war. Millions of these suffered
from it during the entire period of the
conflict, four years three months and fifteen
days, a total of 1,567 days. For almost four
years Germany rolled up a record of victories
on land and of piracies on and under the seas.</p>

<p>Little by little, day after day, piracies dwindled
as the murderous submarine was mastered
and its menace strangled. On the land, the
Allies, under the matchless leadership of Marshal
Ferdinand Foch and the generous co-operation
of Americans, British, French and
Italians, under the great Generals Pershing,
Haig, Pétain and Diaz, wrested the initiative
from von Hindenburg and Ludendorf, late
in July, 1918. Then, in one hundred and fifteen
days of wonderful strategy and the fiercest
fighting the world has ever witnessed, Foch
and the Allies closed upon the Germanic armies
the jaws of a steel trap. A series of brilliant
maneuvers dating from the battle of Château-Thierry
in which the Americans checked the
Teutonic rush, resulted in the defeat and rout
on all the fronts of the Teutonic commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>In that titanic effort, America’s share was
that of the final deciding factor. A nation unjustly
titled the “Dollar Nation,” believed by
Germany and by other countries to be soft,
selfish and wasteful, became over night hard
as tempered steel, self-sacrificing with an altruism
that inspired the world and thrifty beyond
all precedent in order that not only its
own armies but the armies of the Allies might
be fed and munitioned.</p>

<p>Leading American thought and American
action, President Wilson stood out as the
prophet of the democracies of the world. Not
only did he inspire America and the Allies to
a military and naval effort beyond precedent,
but he inspired the civilian populations of the
world to extraordinary effort, efforts that eventually
won the war. For the decision was
gained quite as certainly on the wheat fields
of Western America, in the shops and the
mines and the homes of America as it was
upon the battlefield.</p>

<p>This effort came in response to the following
appeal by the President:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>These, then, are the things we must do, and do well,
besides fighting—the things without which mere fighting
would be fruitless:</p>

<p>We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for
our armies, and our seamen not only, but also for a large
part of the nations with whom we have now made common
cause, in whose support and by whose sides we
shall be fighting;</p>

<p>We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our
shipyards to carry to the other side of the sea, submarines
or no submarines, what will every day be needed
there; and—</p>

<p>Abundant materials out of our fields and our mines
and our factories with which not only to clothe and
equip our own forces on land and sea but also to clothe
and support our people for whom the gallant fellows
under arms can no longer work, to help clothe and equip
the armies with which we are co-operating in Europe,
and to keep the looms and manufactories there in raw
material;</p>

<p>Coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in
the furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea;</p>

<p>Steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both
here and there;</p>

<p>Rails for worn-out railways back of the fighting
fronts;</p>

<p>Locomotives and rolling stock to take the place of
those every day going to pieces;</p>

<p>Everything with which the people of England and
France and Italy and Russia have usually supplied
themselves, but cannot now afford the men, the materials,
or the machinery to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>I particularly appeal to the farmers of the South
to plant abundant foodstuffs as well as cotton. They
can show their patriotism in no better or more convincing
way than by resisting the great temptation of
the present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a
large scale, to feed the nation and the peoples, everywhere
who are fighting for their liberties and for our
own. The variety of their crops will be the visible
measure of their comprehension of their national duty.</p>
</div>

<p>The response was amazing in its enthusiastic
and general compliance. No autocracy issuing
a ukase could have been obeyed so explicitly.
Not only did the various classes of workers
and individuals observe the President’s
suggestions to the letter, but they yielded up
individual right after right in order that the
war work of the government might be expedited.
Extraordinary powers and functions
were granted by the people through Congress,
and it was not until peace was declared that
these rights and powers returned to the people.</p>

<p>These governmental activities ceased functioning
after the war:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>Food administration;</p>

<p>Fuel administration;</p>

<p>Espionage act;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>War trade board;</p>

<p>Alien property custodian (with extension
of time for certain duties);</p>

<p>Agricultural stimulation;</p>

<p>Housing construction (except for ship-builders);</p>

<p>Control of telegraphs and telephones;</p>

<p>Export control.</p>
</div>

<p>These functions were extended:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>Control over railroads: to cease within
twenty-one months after the proclamation
of peace.</p>

<p>The War Finance Corporation: to cease
to function six months after the
war, with further time for liquidation.</p>

<p>The Capital Issues Committee: to terminate
in six months after the peace
proclamation.</p>

<p>The Aircraft Board: to end in six
months after peace was proclaimed;
and the government operation
of ships, within five years
after the war was officially ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>President Wilson, generally acclaimed as
the leader of the world’s democracies, phrased
for civilization the arguments against autocracy
in the great peace conference after the
war. The President headed the American
delegation to that conclave of world re-construction.
With him as delegates to the conference
were Robert Lansing, Secretary of
State; Henry White, former Ambassador to
France and Italy; Edward M. House and
General Tasker H. Bliss.</p>

<p>Representing American Labor at the International
Labor conference held in Paris simultaneously
with the Peace Conference were
Samuel Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor; William Green, secretary-treasurer
of the United Mine Workers of
America; John R. Alpine, president of the
Plumbers’ Union; James Duncan, president
of the International Association of Granite
Cutters; Frank Duffy, president of the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, and
Frank Morrison, secretary of the American
Federation of Labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Estimating the share of each Allied nation
in the great victory, mankind will conclude
that the heaviest cost in proportion to pre-war
population and treasure was paid by the
nations that first felt the shock of war, Belgium,
Serbia, Poland and France. All four
were the battle-grounds of huge armies, oscillating
in a bloody frenzy over once fertile fields
and once prosperous towns.</p>

<p>Belgium, with a population of 8,000,000,
had a casualty list of more than 350,000;
France, with its casualties of 4,000,000 out of
a population (including its colonies) of 90,000,000,
is really the martyr nation of the
world. Her gallant poilus showed the world
how cheerfully men may die in defense of home
and liberty. Huge Russia, including hapless
Poland, had a casualty list of 7,000,000 out
of its entire population of 180,000,000. The
United States out of a population of 110,000,000
had a casualty list of 236,117 for nineteen
months of war; of these 53,169 were killed or
died of disease; 179,625 were wounded; and
3,323 prisoners or missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>To the glory of Great Britain must be recorded
the enormous effort made by its people,
showing through operations of its army
and navy. The British Empire, including the
Colonies, had a casualty list of 3,049,992 men
out of a total population of 440,000,000. Of
these 658,665 were killed; 2,032,122 were
wounded, and 359,204 were reported missing.
It raised an army of 7,000,000, and fought
seven separate foreign campaigns, in France,
Italy, Dardanelles, Mesopotamia, Macedonia,
East Africa and Egypt. It raised its navy
personnel from 115,000 to 450,000 men. Co-operating
with its allies on the sea, it destroyed
approximately one hundred and fifty German
and Austrian submarines. It aided materially
the American navy and transport service in
sending overseas the great American army
whose coming decided the war. The British
navy and transport service during the war
made the following record of transportation
and convoy:</p>

<p>Twenty million men, 2,000,000 horses, 130,000,000
tons of food, 25,000,000 tons of explosives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and supplies, 51,000,000 tons of oil and
fuels, 500,000 vehicles. In 1917 alone 7,000,000
men, 500,000 animals, 200,000 vehicles and
9,500,000 tons of stores were conveyed to the
several war fronts.</p>

<p>The German losses were estimated at 1,588,000
killed or died of disease; 4,000,000
wounded; and over 750,000 prisoners and
missing.</p>

<p>A tabulation of the estimates of casualties
and the money cost of the war reveals the
enormous price paid by humanity to convince
a military-mad Germanic caste that Right and
not Might must hereafter rule the world.
These figures do not include Serbian losses,
which are unavailable. Following is the tabulation:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<span class="smcap">The World Suddenly Turned Upside
Down</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DEMORALIZATION, like the black
plague of the middle ages, spread in
every direction immediately following the first
overt acts of war. Men who were millionaires
at nightfall awoke the next morning to find
themselves bankrupt through depreciation of
their stock-holdings. Prosperous firms of importers
were put out of business. International
commerce was dislocated to an extent
unprecedented in history.</p>

<p>The greatest of hardships immediately following
the war, however, were visited upon
those who unhappily were caught on their vacations
or on their business trips within the
area affected by the war. Not only men, but
women and children, were subjected to privations
of the severest character. Notes which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
had been negotiable, paper money of every description,
and even silver currency suddenly
became of little value. Americans living in
hotels and pensions facing this sudden shrinkage
in their money, were compelled to leave
the roofs that had sheltered them. That which
was true of Americans was true of all other
nationalities, so that every embassy and the
office of every consul became a miniature Babel
of excited, distressed humanity.</p>

<p>The sudden seizure of railroads for war purposes
in Germany, France, Austria and Russia,
cut off thousands of travelers in villages
that were almost inaccessible. Europeans being
comparatively close to their homes, were
not in straits as severe as the Americans whose
only hope for aid lay in the speedy arrival of
American gold. Prices of food soared beyond
all precedent and many of these hapless
strangers went under. Paris, the brightest
and gayest city in Europe, suddenly became
the most sombre of dwelling places. No traffic
was permitted on the highways at night.
No lights were permitted and all the cafés were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
closed at eight o’clock. The gay capital was
placed under iron military rule.</p>

<p>Seaports, and especially the pleasure resorts
in France, Belgium and England, were placed
under a military supervision. Visitors were
ordered to return to their homes and every resort
was shrouded with darkness at night.
The records of those early days are filled with
stories of dramatic happenings.</p>

<p>On the night of July 31st Jean Leon Jaurès,
the famous leader of French Socialists, was
assassinated while dining in a small restaurant
near the Paris Bourse. His assassin was
Raoul Villein. Jaurès had been endeavoring
to accomplish a union of French and German
Socialists with the aim of preventing the war.
The object of the assassination appeared to
have been wholly political.</p>

<p>On the same day stock exchanges throughout
the United States were closed, following
the example of European stock exchanges.
Ship insurance soared to prohibitive figures.
Reservists of the French and German armies
living outside of their native land were called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
to the colors and their homeward rush still
further complicated transportation for civilians.
All the countries of Europe clamored
for gold. North and South America complied
with the demand by sending cargoes of
the precious metal overseas. The German
ship Kron Prinzessin with a cargo of gold, attempted
to make the voyage to Hamburg, but
a wireless warning that Allied cruisers were
waiting for it off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland,
compelled the big ship to turn back
to safety in America.</p>

<p>Channel boats bearing American refugees
from the Continent to London were described
as floating hells. London was excited over
the war and holiday spirit, and overrun with
five thousand citizens of the United States
tearfully pleading with the American Ambassador
for money for transportation home or
assurances of personal safety.</p>

</figure>

<p>The condition of the terror-stricken tourists
fleeing to the friendly shores of England from
Continental countries crowded with soldiers
dragging in their wake heavy guns, resulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
in an extraordinary gathering of two thousand
Americans at a hotel one afternoon and the
formation of a preliminary organization to afford
relief. Some people who attended the
meeting were already beginning to feel the
pinch of want with little prospects of immediate
succor. One man and wife, with four
children, had six cents when he appealed to
Ambassador Page after an exciting escape
from German territory.</p>

<p>Oscar Straus, worth ten millions, struck
London with nine dollars. Although he had
letters of credit for five thousand, he was unable
to cash them in Vienna. Women hugging
newspaper bundles containing expensive
Paris frocks and millinery were herded in
third-class carriages and compelled to stand
many hours. They reached London utterly
fatigued and unkempt, but mainly cheerful,
only to find the hotels choked with fellow countrymen
fortunate to reach there sooner.</p>

<p>The Ambassador was harassed by anxious
women and children who asked many absurd
questions which he could not answer. He said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“The appeals of these people are most distressing.
They are very much excited, and
no small wonder. I regret I have no definite
news of the prospects or plans of the government
for relief. I have communicated their
condition to the Department of State and expect
a response and assurances of coming aid
as soon as possible. That the government will
act I have not the slightest doubt. I am confident
that Washington will do everything in
her power for relief. How soon, I cannot tell.
I have heard many distressing tales during the
last forty-eight hours.”</p>

<p>A crowd filled the Ambassador’s office on
the first floor of the flat building, in Victoria
Street, which was mainly composed of women,
school teachers, art students, and other persons
doing Europe on a shoestring. Many
were entirely out of money and with limited
securities, which were not negotiable.</p>

<p>The action of the British Government extending
the bank holiday till Thursday of that
week was discouraging news for the new arrivals
from the Continent, as it was uncertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
whether the express and steamship companies
would open in the morning for the cashing of
checks and the delivery of mail, as was announced
the previous Saturday.</p>

<p>Doctors J. Riddle Goffe, of New York;
Frank F. Simpson, of Pittsburgh; Arthur D.
Ballon of Vistaburg, Mich., and B. F. Martin,
of Chicago, formed themselves into a committee,
and asked the co-operation of the press in
America to bring about adequate assistance
for the marooned Americans, and to urge the
bankers of the United States to insist on their
letters of credit and travelers’ checks being
honored so far as possible by the agents in Europe
upon whom they were drawn.</p>

<p>Dr. Martin and Dr. Simpson, who left London
on Saturday for Switzerland to fetch back
a young American girl, were unable to get
beyond Paris, and they returned to London.
Everywhere they found trains packed with
refugees whose only object in life apparently
was to reach the channel boats, accepting cheerfully
the discomforts of those vessels if only
able to get out of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Rev. J. P. Garfield, of Claremore, N. H.,
gave the following account of his experiences
in Holland:</p>

<p>“On sailing from the Hook of Holland near
midnight we pulled out just as the boat train
from The Hague arrived. The steamer paused,
but as she was filled to her capacity she later
continued on her voyage, leaving fully two
hundred persons marooned on the wharf.</p>

<p>“Our discomforts while crossing the North
Sea were great. Every seat was filled with
sleepers, the cabins were given to women and
children. The crowd, as a rule, was helpful
and kindly, the single men carrying the babies
and people lending money to those without
funds. Despite the refugee conditions prevailing
it was noticeable that many women on
the Hook wharf clung tenaciously to band
boxes containing Parisian hats.”</p>

<p>Travelers from Cologne said that searchlights
were operated from the tops of the hotels
all night searching for airplanes, and machine
guns were mounted on the famous Cologne
Cathedral. They also reported that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
tourists were refused hotel accommodations at
Frankfort because they were without cash.</p>

<p>Men, women and children sat in the streets
all night. The trains were stopped several
miles from the German frontier and the passengers,
especially the women and children,
suffered great hardships being forced to continue
their journey on foot.</p>

<p>Passengers arriving at London from Montreal
on the Cunard Line steamer Andania,
bound for Southampton, reported the vessel
was met at sea by a British torpedo boat and
ordered by wireless to stop. The liner then
was led into Plymouth as a matter of precaution
against mines. Plymouth was filled with
soldiers, and searchlights were seen constantly
flashing about the harbor.</p>

<p>Otis B. Kent, an attorney for the Interstate
Commerce Commission, of Washington, arrived
in London after an exciting journey from
Petrograd. Unable to find accommodations
at a hotel he slept on the railway station floor.
He said:</p>

<p>“I had been on a trip to Sweden to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
midnight sun. I did not realize the gravity
of the situation until I saw the Russian fleet
cleared for action. This was only July 26th,
at Kronstadt, where the shipyards were working
overtime.</p>

<p>“I arrived at the Russian capital on the
following day. Enormous demonstrations
were taking place. I was warned to get out
and left on the night of the 28th for Berlin.
I saw Russian soldiers drilling at the stations
and artillery constantly on the move.</p>

<p>“At Berlin I was warned to keep off the
streets for fear of being mistaken for an Englishman.
At Hamburg the number of warnings
was increased. Two Russians who refused
to rise in a café when the German anthem
was played were attacked and badly beaten. I
also saw two Englishmen attacked in the street,
but they finally were rescued by the police.</p>

<p>“There was a harrowing scene when the
Hamburg-American Line steamer Imperator
canceled its sailing. She left stranded three
thousand passengers, most of them short of
money, and the women wailing. About one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
hundred and fifty of us were given passage
in the second class of the American Line
steamship Philadelphia, for which I was offered
$400 by a speculator.</p>

<p>“The journey to Flushing was made in a
packed train, its occupants lacking sleep and
food. No trouble was encountered on the
frontier.”</p>

<p>Theodore Hetzler, of the Fifth Avenue
Bank, was appointed chairman of the meeting
for preliminary relief of the stranded tourists,
and committees were named to interview officials
of the steamship companies and of the
hotels, to search for lost baggage, to make arrangements
for the honoring of all proper
checks and notes, and to confer with the members
of the American embassy.</p>

<p>Oscar Straus, who arrived from Paris, said
that the United States embassy there was
working hard to get Americans out of France.
Great enthusiasm prevailed at the French capital,
he said, owing to the announcement that
the United States Government was considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
a plan to send transports to take Americans
home.</p>

<p>The following committees were appointed
at the meeting:</p>

<p>Finance—Theodore Hetzler, Fred I. Kent
and James G. Cannon; Transportation—Joseph
F. Day, Francis M. Weld and George
D. Smith, all of New York; Diplomatic—Oscar
S. Straus, Walter L. Fisher and James
Byrne; Hotels—L. H. Armour, of Chicago,
and Thomas J. Shanley, New York.</p>

<p>The committee established headquarters
where Americans might register and obtain
assistance. Chandler Anderson, a member of
the International Claims Commission, arrived
in London from Paris. He said he had been
engaged with the work of the commission at
Versailles, when he was warned by the American
embassy that he had better leave France.
He acted promptly on this advice and the commission
was adjourned until after the war.
Mr. Anderson had to leave his baggage behind
him because the railway company would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
register it. He said the city of Paris presented
a strange contrast to the ordinary animation
prevailing there. Most of the shops were
closed. There were no taxis in the streets, and
only a few vehicles drawn by horses.</p>

<p>The armored cruiser Tennessee, converted
for the time being into a treasure ship, left
New York on the night of August 6th, 1914,
to carry $7,500,000 in gold to the many thousand
Americans who were in want in European
countries. Included in the $7,500,000
was $2,500,000 appropriated by the government.
Private consignments in gold in sums
from $1,000 to $5,000 were accepted by Colonel
Smith, of the army quartermaster’s department,
who undertook their delivery to
Americans in Paris and other European ports.</p>

<p>The cruiser carried as passengers Ambassador
Willard, who returned to his post at Madrid,
and army and naval officers assigned as
military observers in Europe. On the return
trip accommodations for 200 Americans were
available.</p>

<p>The dreadnaught Florida, after being hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
coaled and provisioned, left the Brooklyn Navy
Yard under sealed orders at 9.30 o’clock the
morning of August 6th and proceeded to
Tompkinsville, where she dropped anchor near
the Tennessee.</p>

<p>The Florida was sent to protect the neutrality
of American ports and prohibit supplies to
belligerent ships. Secretary Daniels ordered
her to watch the port of New York and sent
the Mayflower to Hampton Roads. Destroyers
guarded ports along the New England
coast and those at Lewes, Del., to prevent violations
of neutrality at Philadelphia and in
that territory. Any vessel that attempted to
sail for a belligerent port without clearance
papers was boarded by American officials.</p>

<p>The Texas and Louisiana, at Vera Cruz, and
the Minnesota, at Tampico, were ordered to
New York, and Secretary Daniels announced
that other American vessels would be ordered
north as fast as room could be found for them
in navy yard docks.</p>

<p>At wireless stations, under the censorship
ordered by the President, no code messages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
were allowed in any circumstances. Messages
which might help any of the belligerents in
any way were barred.</p>

<p>The torpedo-boat destroyer Warrington
and the revenue cutter Androscoggin arrived
at Bar Harbor on August 6th, to enforce neutrality
regulations and allowed no foreign
ships to leave Frenchman’s Bay without clearance
papers. The United States cruiser Milwaukee
sailed the same day from the Puget
Sound Navy Yard to form part of the coast
patrol to enforce neutrality regulations.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made in Paris by Myron
T. Herrick, the American Ambassador, acting
under instructions from Washington, to take
over the affairs of the German embassy, while
Alexander H. Thackara, the American Consul
General, looked after the affairs of the German
consulate.</p>

<p>President Poincaré and the members of the
French cabinet later issued a joint proclamation
to the French nation in which was the
phrase “mobilization is not war.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_036">

<p>British Premier, who headed the coalition cabinet which carried England through
the war to victory.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The marching of the soldiers in the streets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
with the English, Russian and French flags
flying, the singing of patriotic songs and the
shouting of “On to Berlin!” were much less
remarkable than the general demeanor and
cold resolution of most of the people.</p>

<p>The response to the order of mobilization
was instant, and the stations of all the railways,
particularly those leading to the eastward,
were crowded with reservists. Many women
accompanied the men until close to the stations,
where, softly crying, farewells were said. The
troop trains left at frequent intervals. All the
automobile busses disappeared, having been
requisitioned by the army to carry meat, the
coachwork of the vehicles being removed and
replaced with specially designed bodies. A
large number of taxicabs, private automobiles
and horses and carts also were taken over by
the military for transport purposes.</p>

<p>The wildest enthusiasm was manifested on
the boulevards when the news of the ordering
of the mobilization became known. Bodies of
men formed into regular companies in ranks
ten deep, paraded the streets waving the tri-color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> 
and other national emblems and cheering
and singing the “Marseillaise” and the
“Internationale,” at the same time throwing
their hats in the air. On the sidewalks were
many weeping women and children. All the
stores and cafés were deserted.</p>

<p>All foreigners were compelled to leave Paris
or France before the end of the first day of
mobilization by train but not by automobile.
Time tables were posted on the walls of Paris
giving the times of certain trains on which
these people might leave the city.</p>

<p>American citizens or British subjects were
allowed to remain in France, except in the regions
on the eastern frontier and near certain
fortresses, provided they made declaration to
the police and obtained a special permit.</p>

<p>As to Italy’s situation, Rome was quite calm
and the normal aspect made tourists decide that
Italy was the safest place. Austria’s note to
Serbia was issued without consulting Italy.
One point of the Triple Alliance provided that
no member should take action in the Balkans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
before an agreement with the other allies.
Such an agreement did not take place. The
alliance was of defensive, not aggressive, character
and could not force an ally to follow any
enterprise taken on the sole account and without
a notice, as such action taken by Austria
against Serbia. It was felt even then that
Italy would eventually cast its lot with the
Entente Allies.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo;
John Skelton Williams, Comptroller
of the Currency; Charles S. Hamblin and William
P. G. Harding, members of the Federal
Reserve Board, went to New York early in
August, 1914, where they discussed relief
measures with a group of leading bankers at
what was regarded as the most momentous conference
of the kind held in the country in recent
years.</p>

<p>The New York Clearing House Committee,
on August 2d, called a meeting of the
Clearing House Association, to arrange for
the immediate issuance of clearing house certificates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Among those at the conference were
J. P. Morgan and his partner, Henry P. Davison;
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the National
City Bank, and A. Barton Hepburn,
chairman of the Chase National Bank.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="smcap">Why the World Went to War</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE it is true that the war was conceived
in Berlin, it is none the less true
that it was born in the Balkans. It is necessary
in order that we may view with correct
perspective the background of the World War,
that we gain some notion of the Balkan States
and the complications entering into their
relations. These countries have been the
adopted children of the great European powers
during generations of rulers. Russia assumed
guardianship of the nations having a
preponderance of Slavic blood; Roumania
with its Latin consanguinities was close to
France and Italy; Bulgaria, Greece, and Balkan
Turkey were debatable regions wherein
the diplomats of the rival nations secured temporary
victories by devious methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>The Balkans have fierce hatreds and have
been the site of sudden historic wars. At the
time of the declaration of the World War, the
Balkan nations were living under the provisions
of the Treaty of Bucharest, dated August
10, 1913. Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria,
Serbia and Montenegro were signers, and Turkey
acquiesced in its provisions.</p>


<p>The assassination at Sarajevo had sent a
convulsive shudder throughout the Balkans.
The reason lay in the century-old antagonism
between the Slav and the Teuton. Serbia,
Montenegro and Russia had never forgiven
Austria for seizing Bosnia and Herzegovina
and making these Slavic people subjects of the
Austrian crown. Bulgaria, Roumania and
Turkey remained cold at the news of the assassination.
German diplomacy was in the ascendant
at these courts and the prospect of
war with Germany as their great ally presented
no terrors for them. The sympathies of the
people of Greece were with Serbia, but the
Grecian Court, because the Queen of Greece
was the only sister of the German Kaiser, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
whole heartedly with Austria. Perhaps at the
first the Roumanians were most nearly neutral.
They believed strongly that each of the small
nations of the Balkan region as well as all of
the small nations that had been absorbed but
had not been digested by Austria, should cut
itself from the leading strings held by the large
European powers. There was a distinct undercurrent
for a federation resembling that of
the United States of America between these
peoples. This was expressed most clearly by
M. Jonesco, leader of the Liberal party of
Roumania and generally recognized as the
ablest statesman of middle Europe. He declared:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_043">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST, 1913</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I always believed, and still believe, that the
Balkan States cannot secure their future otherwise
than by a close understanding among
themselves, whether this understanding shall
or shall not take the form of a federation. No
one of the Balkan States is strong enough to
resist the pressure from one or another of the
European powers.</p>

<p class="caption">FRANCIS JOSEPH I OF AUSTRIA, THE “OLD EMPEROR,” ON A STATE OCCASION</p>

<p>Francis Joseph died before the war had settled the fate of the Hapsburgs. The end came on November 21, 1916, in the sixty-eighth
year of his reign. His life was tragic. He lived to see his brother executed, his Queen assassinated, and his only son a suicide, with
always before him the specter of the disintegration of his many-raced empire.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“For this reason I am deeply grieved to see
in the Balkan coalition of 1912 Roumania not
invited. If Roumania had taken part in the
first one, we should not have had the second.
I did all that was in my power and succeeded
in preventing the war between Roumania and
the Balkan League in the winter of 1912-13.</p>

<p>“I risked my popularity, and I do not feel
sorry for it. I employed all my efforts to prevent
the second Balkan war, which, as is well
known, was profitable to us. I repeatedly told
the Bulgarians that they ought not to enter
it because in that case we would enter it too.
But I was not successful in my efforts.</p>

<p>“During the second Balkan war I did all in
my power to end it as quickly as possible. At
the conference at Bucharest I made efforts, as
Mr. Pashich and Mr. Venizelos know very
well, to secure for beaten Bulgaria the best
terms. My object was to obtain a new coalition
of all the Balkan States, including Roumania.
Had I succeeded in this the situation
would be much better. No reasonable man
will deny that the Balkan States are neutralizing
each other at the present time, which in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
itself makes the whole situation all the more
miserable.</p>

<p>“In October, 1913, when I succeeded in facilitating
the conclusion of peace between
Greece and Turkey, I was pursuing the same
object of the Balkan coalition. On my return
from Athens I endeavored, though without
success, to put the Greco-Turkish relations
on a basis of friendship, being convinced that
the well-understood interest of both countries
lies not only in friendly relations, but even in
an alliance between them.</p>

<p>“The dissensions that exist between the Balkan
States can be settled in a friendly way
without war. The best moment for this would
be after the general war, when the map of Europe
will be remade. The Balkan country
which would start war against another Balkan
country would commit, not only a crime against
her own future, but an act of folly as well.</p>

<p>“The destiny and future of the Balkan
States, and of all the small European peoples
as well, will not be regulated by fratricidal
wars, but, with this great European struggle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the real object of which is to settle the question
whether Europe shall enter an era of justice,
and therefore happiness for the small peoples,
or whether we will face a period of oppression
more or less gilt-edged. And as I always believed
that wisdom and truth will triumph in
the end, I want to believe, too, that, in spite
of the pessimistic news reaching me from the
different sides of the Balkan countries, there
will be no war among them in order to justify
those who do not believe in the vitality of the
small peoples.”</p>

<p>The conference at Rome, April 10, 1918,
to settle outstanding questions between the
Italians and the Slavs of the Adriatic, drew
attention to those Slavonic peoples in Europe
who were under non-Slavonic rule. At the
beginning of the war there were three great
Slavonic groups in Europe: First, the Russians
with the Little Russians, speaking languages
not more different than the dialect of
Yorkshire is from the dialect of Devonshire;
second, a central group, including the Poles,
the Czechs or Bohemians, the Moravians, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Slovaks, this group thus being separated under
the four crowns of Russia, Germany, Austria
and Hungary; the third, the southern group,
included the Sclavonians, the Croatians, the
Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, the
Slavs, generally called Slovenes, in the western
part of Austria, down to Gorizia, and also the
two independent kingdoms of Montenegro and
Serbia.</p>

<p>Like the central group, this southern group
of Slavs was divided under four crowns, Hungary,
Austria, Montenegro, and Serbia; but,
in spite of the fact that half belong to the Western
and half to the Eastern Church, they are
all essentially the same people, though with
considerable infusion of non-Slavonic blood,
there being a good deal of Turkish blood in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The languages,
however, are practically identical, formed
largely of pure Slavonic materials, and, curiously,
much more closely connected with the
eastern Slav group—Russia and Little Russia—than
with the central group, Polish and Bohemian.
A Russian of Moscow will find it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
much easier to understand a Slovene from
Gorizia than a Pole from Warsaw. The
Ruthenians, in southern Galicia and Bukowina,
are identical in race and speech with the
Little Russians of Ukrainia.</p>

<p>Of the central group, the Poles have generally
inclined to Austria, which has always supported
the Polish landlords of Galicia against
the Ruthenian peasantry; while the Czechs
have been not so much anti-Austrian as anti-German.
Indeed, the Hapsburg rulers have
again and again played these Slavs off against
their German subjects. It was the Southern
Slav question as affecting Serbia and Austria,
that gave the pretext for the present war. The
central Slav question affecting the destiny of
the Poles—was a bone of contention between
Austria and Germany. It is the custom to
call the Southern Slavs “Jugoslavs” from the
Slav word Yugo, “south,” but as this is a concession
to German transliteration many prefer
to write the word “Yugoslav,” which represents
its pronunciation. The South Slav question
was created by the incursions of three Asiatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
peoples—Huns, Magyars, Turks—who broke
up the originally continuous Slav territory that
ran from the White Sea to the confines of
Greece and the Adriatic.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Mixture of Races in South Central Europe</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This was the complex of nationalities, the
ferment of races existing in 1914. Out of the
hatreds engendered by the domination over
the liberty-loving Slavic peoples by an arrogant
Teutonic minority grew the assassinations
at Sarajevo. These crimes were the expression
of hatred not for the heir apparent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Austria but for the Hapsburgs and their Germanic
associates.</p>

<p>By a twist of the wheel of fate, the same
Slavic peoples whose determination to rid
themselves of the Teutonic yoke, started the
war, also bore rather more than their share in
the swift-moving events that decided and
closed the war.</p>

<p>Russia, the dying giant among the great nations,
championed the Slavic peoples at the
beginning of the war. It entered the conflict
in aid of little Serbia, but at the end Russia
bowed to Germany in the infamous peace treaty
at Brest-Litovsk. Thereafter during the last
months of the war Russia was virtually an ally
of its ancient enemy, Turkey, the “Sick Man
of Europe,” and the central German empires.
With these allies the Bolshevik government of
Russia attempted to head off the Czecho-Slovak
regiments that had been captured by
Russia during its drive into Austria and had
been imprisoned in Siberia. After the peace
consummated at Brest-Litovsk, these regiments
determined to fight on the side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Allies and endeavored to make their way to
the western front.</p>

<p>No war problems were more difficult than
those of the Czecho-Slovaks. Few have been
handled so masterfully. Surrounded by powerful
enemies which for centuries have been
bent on destroying every trace of Slavic culture,
they had learned how to defend themselves
against every trick or scheme of the
brutal Germans.</p>

<p>The Czecho-Slovak plan in Russia was of
great value to the Allies all over the world, and
was put at their service by Professor Thomas
G. Masaryk. He went to Russia when everything
was adrift and got hold of Bohemian
prisoners here and there and organized them
into a compact little army of 50,000 to 60,000
men. Equipped and fed, he moved them to
whatever point had most power to thoroughly
disrupt the German plans. They did much to
check the German army for months. They
resolutely refused to take any part in Russian
political affairs, and when it seemed no longer
possible to work effectively in Russia, this remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
little band started on a journey all
round the world to get to the western front.
They loyally gave up most of their arms under
agreement with Lenine and Trotzky that they
might peacefully proceed out of Russia via
Vladivostok.</p>

<p>While they were carrying out their part of
the agreement, and well on the way, they were
surprised by telegrams from Lenine and
Trotzky to the Soviets in Siberia ordering
them to take away their arms and intern them.</p>

<p>The story of what occurred then was told by
two American engineers, Emerson and Hawkins,
who, on the way to Ambassador Francis,
and not being able to reach Bologda, joined a
band of four or five thousand. The engineers
were with them three months, while they were
making it safe along the lines of the railroad
for the rest of the Czecho-Slovaks to get out,
and incidentally for Siberians to resume peaceful
occupations. They were also supported
by old railway organizations which had stuck
bravely to them without wages and which every
little while were “shot up” by the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Distress in Russia would have been much
more intense had it not been for the loyalty of
the railway men in sticking to their tasks.
Some American engineers at Irkutsk, on a
peaceful journey, out of Russia, on descending
from the cars were met with a demand to surrender,
and shots from machine guns. Some,
fortunately, had kept hand grenades, and with
these and a few rifles went straight at the machine
guns. Although outnumbered, the attackers
took the guns and soon afterward took
the town. The Czecho-Slovaks, in the beginning
almost unarmed, went against great odds
and won for themselves the right to be considered
a nation.</p>

<p>Seeing the treachery of Lenine and Trotzky,
they went back toward the west and made
things secure for their men left behind. They
took town after town with the arms they first
took away from the Bolsheviki and Germans;
but in every town they immediately set up a
government, with all the elements of normal
life. They established police and sanitary
systems, opened hospitals, and had roads repaired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
leaving a handful of men in the midst
of enemies to carry on the plans of their leaders.
American engineers speaking of the
cleanliness of the Czecho-Slovak army, said
that they lived like Spartans.</p>

<p>The whole story is a remarkable evidence of
the struggle of these little people for self-government.</p>

<p>The emergence of the Czecho-Slovak nation
has been one of the most remarkable and noteworthy
features of the war. Out of the confusion
of the situation, with the possibility of
the resurrection of oppressed peoples, something
of the dignity of old Bohemia was comprehended,
and it was recognized that the
Czechs were to be rescued from Austria and the
Slovaks from Hungary, and united in one
country with entire independence. This was
undoubtedly due, in large measure, to the activities
of Professor Masaryk, the president of
the National Executive Council of the Czecho-Slovaks.
His four-year exile in the United
States had the establishment of the new nation
as its fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Professor Masaryk called attention to the
fact that there is a peculiar discrepancy between
the number of states in Europe and the
number of nationalities—twenty-seven states
to seventy nationalities. He explained, also,
that almost all the states are mixed, from the
point of nationality. From the west of Europe
to the east, this is found to be true, and
the farther east one goes the more mixed do the
states become. Austria is the most mixed of
all the states. There is no Austrian language,
but there are nine languages, and six smaller
nations or remnants of nations. In all of Germany
there are eight nationalities besides the
Germans, who have been independent, and who
have their own literature. Turkey is an anomaly,
a combination of various nations overthrown
and kept down.</p>

<p>Since the eighteenth century there has been
a continuing strong movement from each nation
to have its own state. Because of the
mixed peoples, there is much confusion. There
are Roumanians in Austria, but there is a kingdom
of Roumania. There are Southern Slavs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
but there are also Serbia and Montenegro.
It is natural that the Southern Slavs should
want to be united as one state. So it is with
Italy.</p>

<p>There was no justice in Poland being separated
in three parts to serve the dynasties of
Prussia, Russia and Austria. The Czecho-Slovaks
of Austria and Hungary claimed a
union. The national union consists in an endeavor
to make the suppressed nations free,
to unite them in their own states, and to readjust
the states that exist; to force Austria and
Prussia to give up the states that should be
free.</p>

<p>In the future, said Doctor Masaryk, there
are to be sharp ethnological boundaries. The
Czecho-Slovaks will guarantee the minorities
absolute equality, but they will keep the German
part of their country, because there are
many Bohemians in it, and they do not trust
the Germans.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Plotter Behind the Scene</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE factor alone caused the great war.
It was not the assassination at Sarajevo,
not the Slavic ferment of anti-Teutonism
in Austria and the Balkans. The only
cause of the world’s greatest war was the determination
of the German High Command
and the powerful circle surrounding it that
“<i>Der Tag</i>” had arrived. The assassination at
Sarajevo was only the peg for the pendant of
war. Another peg would have been found inevitably
had not the projection of that assassination
presented itself as the excuse.</p>

<p>Germany’s military machine was ready. A
gray-green uniform that at a distance would
fade into misty obscurity had been devised after
exhaustive experiments by optical, dye and
cloth experts co-operating with the military
high command. These uniforms had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
standardized and fitted for the millions of men
enrolled in Germany’s regular and reserve
armies. Rifles, great pyramids of munitions,
field kitchens, traveling post-offices, motor lorries,
a network of military railways leading to
the French and Belgian border, all these and
more had been made ready. German soldiers
had received instructions which enabled each
man at a signal to go to an appointed place
where he found everything in readiness for his
long forced marches into the territory of Germany’s
neighbors.</p>

<p>More than all this, Germany’s spy system,
the most elaborate and unscrupulous in the history
of mankind, had enabled the German
High Command to construct in advance of the
declaration of war concrete gun emplacements
in Belgium and other invaded territory. The
cellars of dwellings and shops rented or owned
by German spies were camouflaged concrete
foundations for the great guns of Austria and
Germany. These emplacements were in exactly
the right position for use against the fortresses
of Germany’s foes. Advertisements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and shop-signs were used by spies as guides for
the marching German armies of invasion.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Germany’s Possessions in Africa Prior to 1914</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In brief, Germany had planned for war.
She was approximately ready for it. Under
the shelter of such high-sounding phrases as
“We demand our place in the sun,” and “The
seas must be free,” the German people were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
educated into the belief that the hour of Germany’s
destiny was at hand.</p>

<p>German psychologists, like other German
scientists, had co-operated with the imperial
militaristic government for many years to
bring the Germanic mind into a condition of
docility. So well did they understand the
mentality and the trends of character of the
German people that it was comparatively easy
to impose upon them a militaristic system and
philosophy by which the individual yielded
countless personal liberties for the alleged good
of the state. Rigorous and compulsory military
service, unquestioning adherence to the
doctrine that might makes right and a cession
to “the All-Highest,” as the Emperor was
styled, of supreme powers in the state, are some
of the sufferances to which the German people
submitted.</p>

<p>German propaganda abroad was quite as
vigorous as at home, but infinitely less successful.
The German High Command did not
expect England to enter the war. It counted
upon America’s neutrality with a leaning toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Germany. It believed that German colonization
in South Africa and South America
would incline these vast domains toward friendship
for the Central Empire. How mistaken
the propagandists and psychologists were
events have demonstrated.</p>

<p>It was this dream of world-domination by
Teutonic kultur that supplied the motive leading
to the world’s greatest war. Bosnia, an
unwilling province of Austria-Hungary, at one
time a province of Serbia and overwhelmingly
Slavic in its population, had been seething for
years with an anti-Teutonic ferment. The
Teutonic court at Vienna, leading the minority
Germanic party in Austria-Hungary, had
been endeavoring to allay the agitation among
the Bosnian Slavs. In pursuance of that policy,
Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir-presumptive
to the thrones of Austria and Hungary,
and his morganatic wife, Sophia Chotek,
Duchess of Hohenberg, on June 28, 1914, visited
Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. On the
morning of that day, while they were being
driven through the narrow streets of the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
town, a bomb was thrown at them, but
they were uninjured. They were driven
through the streets again in the afternoon, for
purpose of public display. A student, just out
of his ’teens, one Gavrilo Prinzep, attacked the
royal party with a magazine pistol and killed
both the Archduke and his wife.</p>

<p>Here was the excuse for which Germany had
waited. Here was the dawn of “The Day.”
The Germanic court of Austria asserted that
the crime was the result of a conspiracy, leading
directly to the Slavic court of Serbia. The
Serbians in their turn declared that they knew
nothing of the assassination. They pointed
out the fact that Sophia Chotek was a Slav, and
that Francis Ferdinand was more liberal than
any other member of the Austrian royal household,
and finally, that he, more than any other
member of the Austrian court, understood and
respected the Slavic character and aspirations.</p>

<p>At six o’clock on the evening of July 23d,
Austria sent an ultimatum to Serbia, presenting
eleven demands and stipulating that categorical
replies must be delivered before six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
o’clock on the evening of July 25th. Although
the language in which the ultimatum was
couched was humiliating to Serbia, the answer
was duly delivered within the stipulated time.</p>

<p>The demands of the Austrian note in brief
were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The Serbian Government to give formal assurance
of its condemnation of Serb propaganda against
Austria.</p>

<p>2. The next issue of the Serbian “Official Journal”
was to contain a declaration to that effect.</p>

<p>3. This declaration to express regret that Serbian
officers had taken part in the propaganda.</p>

<p>4. The Serbian Government to promise that it would
proceed rigorously against all guilty of such activity.</p>

<p>5. This declaration to be at once communicated by
the King of Serbia to his army, and to be published in
the official bulletin as an order of the day.</p>

<p>6. All anti-Austrian publications in Serbia to be suppressed.</p>

<p>7. The Serbian political party known as the “National
Union” to be suppressed, and its means of propaganda
to be confiscated.</p>

<p>8. All anti-Austrian teaching in the schools of Serbia
to be suppressed.</p>

<p>9. All officers, civil and military, who might be designated
by Austria as guilty of anti-Austrian propaganda
to be dismissed by the Serbian Government.</p>

<p>10. Austrian agents to co-operate with the Serbian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Government in suppressing all anti-Austrian propaganda,
and to take part in the judicial proceedings conducted
in Serbia against those charged with complicity
in the crime at Sarajevo.</p>

<p>11. Serbia to explain to Austria the meaning of anti-Austrian
utterances of Serbian officials at home and
abroad, since the assassination.</p>
</div>

<p>To the first and second demands Serbia unhesitatingly
assented.</p>

<p>To the third demand, Serbia assented, although
no evidence was given to show that Serbian
officers had taken part in the propaganda.</p>

<p>The Serbian Government assented to the
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth demands
also.</p>

<p>Extraordinary as was the ninth demand,
which would allow the Austrian Government
to proscribe Serbian officials, so eager for peace
and friendship was the Serbian Government
that it assented to it, with the stipulation that
the Austrian Government should offer some
proof of the guilt of the proscribed officers.</p>

<p>The tenth demand, which in effect allowed
Austrian agents to control the police and
courts of Serbia, it was not possible for Serbia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to accept without abrogating her sovereignty.
However, it was not unconditionally rejected,
but the Serbian Government asked that it be
made the subject of further discussion, or be
referred to arbitration.</p>

<p>The Serbian Government assented to the
eleventh demand, on the condition that if the
explanations which would be given concerning
the alleged anti-Austrian utterances of Serbian
officials would not prove satisfactory to the
Austrian Government, the matter should be
submitted to mediation or arbitration.</p>

<p>Behind the threat conveyed in the Austrian
ultimatum was the menacing figure of militant
Germany. The veil that had hitherto concealed
the hands that worked the string, was
removed when Germany, under the pretense
of localizing the quarrel to Serbian and Austrian
soil, interrogated France and England,
asking them to prevent Russia from defending
Serbia in the event of an attack by Austria
upon the Serbs. England and France
promptly refused to participate in a tragedy
which would deliver Serbia to Austria as Bosnia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
had been delivered. Russia, bound by race
and creed to Serbia, read into the ultimatum of
Teutonic kultur a determination for warfare.
Mobilization of the Russian forces along the
Austrian frontier was arranged, when it was
seen that Serbia’s pacific reply to Austria’s demands
would be contemptuously disregarded
by Germany and Austria.</p>

<p>During the days that intervened between the
issuance of the ultimatum and the actual declaration
of war by Germany against Russia on
Saturday, August 1st, various sincere efforts
were made to stave off the world-shaking catastrophe.
Arranged chronologically, these
events may thus be summarized: Russia, on
July 24th, formally asked Austria if she intended
to annex Serbian territory by way of
reprisal for the assassination at Sarajevo. On
the same day Austria replied that it had no
present intention to make such annexation.
Russia then requested an extension of the
forty-eight-hour time limit named in the ultimatum.</p>

<p>Austria, on the morning of Saturday, July<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
25th, refused Russia’s request for an extension
of the period named in the ultimatum. On
the same day, the newspapers published in
Petrograd printed an official note issued by the
Russian Government warning Europe generally
that Russia would not remain indifferent
to the fate of Serbia. These newspapers also
printed the appeal of the Serbian Crown Prince
to the Czar dated on the preceding day, urging
that Russia come to the rescue of the menaced
Serbs. Serbia’s peaceful reply surrendering
on all points except one, and agreeing to submit
that to arbitration, was sent late in the
afternoon of the same day, and that night Austria
declared the reply to be unsatisfactory and
withdrew its minister from Belgrade.</p>

<p>England commenced its attempts at pacification
on the following day, Sunday, July 26th.
Sir Edward Grey spent the entire Sabbath in
the Foreign Office and personally conducted
the correspondence that was calculated to bring
the dispute to a peaceful conclusion. He did
not reckon, however, with a Germany determined
upon war, a Germany whose manufacturers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
ship-owners and Junkers had combined
with its militarists to achieve “Germany’s place
in the sun” even though the world would be
stained in the blood of the most frightful war
this earth has ever known. Realization of this
fact did not come to Sir Edward Grey until his
negotiations with Germany and with Austria-Hungary
had proceeded for some time. His
first suggestion was that the dispute between
Russia and Austria be committed to the arbitration
of Great Britain, France, Italy and
Germany. Russia accepted this but Germany
and Austria rejected it. Russia had previously
suggested that the dispute be settled by
a conference between the diplomatic heads at
Vienna and Petrograd. This also was refused
by Austria.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey renewed his efforts on
Monday, July 27th, with an invitation to Germany
to present suggestions of its own, looking
toward a settlement. This note was never answered.
Germany took the position that its
proposition to compel Russia to stand aside
while Austria punished Serbia had been rejected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
by England and France and it had nothing
further to propose.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The German Confederation in 1815</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>During all this period of negotiation the
German Foreign Office, to all outward appearances
at least, had been acting independently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of the Kaiser, who was in Norway on a vacation
trip. He returned to Potsdam on the
night of Sunday, July 26th. On Monday
morning the Czar of Russia received a personal
message from the Kaiser, urging Russia to
stand aside that Serbia might be punished.
The Czar immediately replied with the suggestion
that the whole matter be submitted to
The Hague. No reply of any kind was ever
made to this proposal by Germany.</p>

<p>All suggestions and negotiations looking
forward to peace were brought to a tragic end
on the following day, Tuesday, July 28th, when
Austria declared war on Serbia, having speedily
mobilized troops at strategic points on the
Serbian border. Russian mobilization, which
had been proceeding only in a tentative way,
on the Austrian border, now became general,
and on July 30th, mobilization of the entire
Russian army was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Germany’s effort to exclude England from
the war began on Thursday, July 30th. A
note, sounding Sir Edward Grey on the question
of British neutrality in the event of war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
was received, and a curt refusal to commit the
British Empire to such a proposal was the
reply. Sir Edward Grey, in a last determined
effort to avoid a world war, suggested
to Germany, Austria, Serbia and Russia that
the military operations commenced by Austria
should be recognized as merely a punitive expedition.
He further suggested that when a
point in Serbian territory previously fixed
upon should have been reached, Austria would
halt and would submit her further action to arbitration
in the conference of the Powers. Russia
agreed unreservedly to this proposition.
Austria gave a half-hearted assent to the principle
involved. Germany made no reply.</p>

<p>The die was cast for war on the following
day, July 31st, when Germany made a dictatorial
and arrogant demand upon Russia that
mobilization of that nation’s military forces be
stopped within twelve hours. Russia made no
reply, and on Saturday, August 1st, Germany
set the world aflame with the dread of war’s
horror by her declaration of war upon Russia.</p>

<p>Germany’s responsibility for this monumental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
crime against the peace of the world is
eternally fixed upon her, not only by these outward
and visible acts and negotiations, not only
by her years of patient preparation for the war
into which she plunged the world. The responsibility
is fastened upon her forever by the
revelations of her own ambassador to England
during this fateful period. Prince Lichnowsky,
in a remarkable communication which was
given to the world, laid bare the machinations
of the German High Command and its advisers.
He was a guest of the Kaiser at Kiel
on board the Imperial yacht Meteor when the
message was received informing the Kaiser of
the assassination at Sarajevo. His story continues.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Being unacquainted with the Vienna viewpoint and
what was going on there, I attached no very far-reaching
significance to the event; but, looking back, I could
feel sure that in the Austrian aristocracy a feeling of relief
outweighed all others. His Majesty regretted that
his efforts to win over the Archduke to his ideas had
thus been frustrated by the Archduke’s assassination....</p>

<p>I went on to Berlin and saw the Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg.
I told him that I regarded our foreign
situation as very satisfactory as it was a long time indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
since we had stood so well with England. And in
France there was a pacifist cabinet. Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg
did not seem to share my optimism. He
complained of the Russian armaments. I tried to tranquilize
him with the argument that it was not to Russia’s
interest to attack us, and that such an attack would
never have English or French support, as both countries
wanted peace.</p>

<p>I went from him to Dr. Zimmermann (the under Secretary)
who was acting for Herr von Jagow (the Foreign
Secretary), and learned from him that Russia was
about to call up nine hundred thousand new troops. His
words unmistakably denoted ill-humor against Russia,
who, he said, stood everywhere in our way. In addition,
there were questions of commercial policy that had to be
settled. That General von Moltke was urging war was,
of course, not told to me. I learned, however, that Herr
von Tschirschky (the German Ambassador at Vienna)
had been reproved because he said that he had advised
Vienna to show moderation toward Serbia.</p>
</div>

<p>Prince Lichnowsky went to his summer
home in Silesia, quite unaware of the impending
crisis. He continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When I returned from Silesia on my way to London,
I stopped only a few hours in Berlin, where I heard
that Austria intended to proceed against Serbia so as to
bring to an end an unbearable state of affairs. Unfortunately,
I failed at the moment to gauge the significance
of the news. I thought that once more it would come to
nothing; that even if Russia acted threateningly, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
matter could soon be settled. I now regret that I did
not stay in Berlin and declare there and then that I
would have no hand in such a policy.</p>
</div>

<p>There was a meeting in Potsdam, as early
as July 5th, between the German and Austrian
authorities, at which meeting war was decided
on. Prince Lichnowsky says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I learned afterwards that at the decisive discussion at
Potsdam on July 5th the Austrian demand had met with
the unconditional approval of all the personages in authority;
it was even added that no harm would be done
if war with Russia did come out of it. It was so stated
at least in the Austrian report received at London by
Count Mensdorff (the Austrian Ambassador to England).</p>

<p>At this point I received instructions to endeavor to
bring the English press to a friendly attitude in case
Austria should deal the death-blow to “Greater-Serbian”
hopes. I was to use all my influence to prevent public
opinion in England from taking a stand against Austria.
I remember England’s attitude during the Bosnian annexation
crisis, when public opinion showed itself in
sympathy with the Serbian claims to Bosnia; I recalled
also the benevolent promotion of nationalist hopes that
went on in the days of Lord Byron and Garibaldi; and
on these and other grounds I thought it extremely unlikely
that English public opinion would support a punitive
expedition against the Archduke’s murderers. I
thus felt it my duty to enter an urgent warning against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the whole project, which I characterized as venturesome
and dangerous, I recommended that counsels of moderation
be given Austria, as I did not believe that the conflict
could be localized (that is to say, it could not be
limited to a war between Austria and Serbia).</p>

<p>Herr von Jagow answered me that Russia was not
prepared; that there would be more or less of a rumpus;
but that the more firmly we stood by Austria, the more
surely would Russia give way. Austria was already
blaming us for flabbiness and we could not flinch. On
the other hand, Russian sentiment was growing more
unfriendly all the time, and we must simply take the risk.
I subsequently learned that this attitude was based on
advices from Count Pourtales (the German Ambassador
in Petrograd), that Russia would not stir under any circumstances;
information which prompted us to spur
Count Berchtold on in his course. On learning the attitude
of the German Government I looked for salvation
through English mediation, knowing that Sir Edward
Grey’s influence in Petrograd could be used in the cause
of peace. I therefore, availed myself of my friendly
relations with the Minister to ask him confidentially to
advise moderation in Russia in case Austria demanded
satisfaction from the Serbians, as it seemed likely she
would.</p>

<p>The English press was quiet at first, and friendly to
Austria, the assassination being generally condemned.
By degrees, however, more and more voices made themselves
heard, in the sense that, however necessary it
might be to take cognizance of the crime, any exploitation
of it for political ends was unjustifiable. Moderation
was enjoined upon Austria. When the ultimatum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
came out, all the papers, with the exception of the <i>Standard</i>,
were unanimous in condemning it. The whole
world, outside of Berlin and Vienna, realized that it
meant war, and a world war too. The English fleet,
which happened to have been holding a naval review, was
not demobilized.</p>
</div>

<p>The British Government labored to make
the Serbian reply conciliatory, and “the Serbian
answer was in keeping with the British
efforts.” Sir Edward Grey then proposed his
plan of mediation upon the two points which
Serbia had not wholly conceded. Prince Lichnowsky
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Cambon (for France), Marquis Imperiali (for
Italy), and I were to meet, with Sir Edward in the
chair, and it would have been easy to work out a formula
for the debated points, which had to do with the
co-operation of imperial and royal officials in the inquiries
to be conducted at Belgrade. By the exercise of
good-will everything could have been settled in one or
two sittings, and the mere acceptance of the British
proposal would have relieved the strain and further
improved our relations with England. I seconded this
plan with all my energies. In vain. I was told (by
Berlin) that it would be against the dignity of Austria.
Of course, all that was needed was one hint from Berlin
to Count Berchtold (the Austrian Foreign Minister); he
would have satisfied himself with a diplomatic triumph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and rested on the Serbian answer. That hint was never
given. On the contrary, pressure was brought in favor
of war....</p>

<p>After our refusal Sir Edward asked us to come forward
with our proposal. We insisted on war. No other
answer could I get (from Berlin) than that it was a
colossal condescension on the part of Austria not to contemplate
any acquisition of territory. Sir Edward
justly pointed out that one could reduce a country to
vassalage without acquiring territory; that Russia would
see this, and regard it as a humiliation not to be put up
with. The impression grew stronger and stronger that
we were bent on war. Otherwise our attitude toward a
question in which we were not directly concerned was
incomprehensible. The insistent requests and well-defined
declarations of M. Sasanof, the Czar’s positively
humble telegrams, Sir Edward’s repeated proposals, the
warnings of Marquis San Guiliano and of Bollati, my
own pressing admonitions were all of no avail. Berlin
remained inflexible—Serbia must be slaughtered.</p>

<p>Then, on the 29th, Sir Edward decided upon his well-known
warning. I told him I had always reported (to
Berlin) that we should have to reckon with English
opposition if it came to a war with France. Time and
again the Minister said to me, “If war breaks out it will
be the greatest catastrophe the world has ever seen.”
And now events moved rapidly. Count Berchtold at last
decided to come around, having up to that point played
the rôle of “Strong man” under guidance of Berlin.
Thereupon we (in answer to Russia’s mobilization) sent
our ultimatum and declaration of war—after Russia had
spent a whole week in fruitless negotiation and waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Thus ended my mission in London. It had suffered
shipwreck, not on the wiles of the Briton but on the wiles
of our own policy. Were not those right who saw that
the German people were pervaded with the spirit of
Treitschke and Bernhardi, which glorifies war as an end
instead of holding it in abhorrence as an evil thing?
Properly speaking militarism is a school for the people
and an instrument to further political ends. But in the
patriarchal absolutism of a military monarchy, militarism
exploits politics to further its own ends, and can
create a situation which a democracy freed from junkerdom
would not tolerate.</p>

<p>That is what our enemies think; that is what they
are bound to think when they see that in spite of capitalistic
industrialism and in spite of socialistic organizations,
the living, as Nietzsche said, are still ruled by the
dead. The democratization of Germany, the first war
aim proposed by our enemies, will become a reality.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the frank statement of a great German
statesman made long before Germany received
its knock-out blow. It was written
when German militarism was sweeping all before
it on land, and when the U-boat was at
the height of its murderous powers on the high
seas.</p>

<p>No one in nor out of Germany has controverted
any of its statements and it will forever
remain as one of the counts in the indictment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
against Germany and the sole cause of the
world’s greatest misery, the war.</p>

<p>America’s outstanding authority on matters
of international conduct, former Secretary of
State Elihu Root, declared that the World War
was a mighty and all-embracing struggle between
two conflicting principles of human right
and human duty; it was a conflict between the
divine right of kings to govern mankind
through armies and nobles, and the right of the
peoples of the earth who toil and endure and aspire
to govern themselves by law under justice,
and in the freedom of individual manhood.</p>

<p>After the declaration of war against Russia
by Germany, events marched rapidly and inevitably
toward the general conflagration.
Germany’s most strenuous efforts were directed
toward keeping England out of the conflict.
We have seen in the revelations of
Prince Lichnowsky how eager was England to
divert Germany’s murderous purpose. There
are some details, however, required to fill in the
diplomatic picture.</p>

<p>President Poincaré, of the French Republic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
on July 30th, asked the British Ambassador
in Paris for an assurance of British support.
On the following day he addressed a similar
letter to King George of England. Both requests
were qualifiedly refused on the ground
that England wished to be free to continue negotiations
with Germany for the purpose of
averting the war. In the meantime, the German
Government addressed a note to England
offering guarantees for Belgian integrity, providing
Belgium did not side with France, offering
to respect the neutrality of Holland
and giving assurance that no French territory
in Europe would be annexed if Germany won
the war. Sir Edward Grey described this as a
“shameful proposal,” and rejected it on July
30th.</p>

<p>On July 31st England sent a note to France
and Germany asking for a statement of purpose
concerning Belgian neutrality. France
immediately announced that it would respect
the treaty of 1839 and its reaffirmation in 1870,
guaranteeing Belgium’s neutrality. This
treaty was entered into by Germany, England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
France, Austria and Russia. Germany’s reply
on August 1st was a proposal that she
would respect the neutrality of Belgium if
England would stay out of the war. This was
promptly declined. On August 2d the British
cabinet agreed that if the German fleet attempted
to attack the coast of France the British
fleet would intervene. Germany, the next
day, sent a note agreeing to refrain from naval
attacks on France provided England would
remain neutral, but declined to commit herself
as to the neutrality of Belgium. Before this,
however, on August 2d, Germany had announced
to Belgium its intention to enter Belgium
for the purpose of attacking France.
The Belgian Minister in London made an appeal
to the British Foreign Office and was informed
that invasion of Belgium by Germany
would be followed by England’s declaration of
war. Monday, August 3d, was signalized by
Belgium’s declaration of its neutrality and its
firm purpose to defend its soil against invasion
by France, England, Germany or any other
nation.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>The actual invasion of Belgium commenced
on the morning of August 4th, when twelve
regiments of Uhlans crossed the frontier near
Vise, and came in contact with a Belgian force
driving it back upon Liége. King Albert of
Belgium promptly appealed to England, Russia
and France for aid in repelling the invader.
England sent an ultimatum to Germany fixing
midnight of August 4th as the time for expiration
of the ultimatum. This demanded
that satisfactory assurances be furnished immediately
that Germany would respect the
neutrality of Belgium. No reply was made
by Germany and England’s declaration of war
followed.</p>

<p>Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, of the
German Empire, wrote Germany’s infamy into
history when, in a formal statement, he acknowledged
that the invasion of Belgium was
“a wrong that we will try to make good again
as soon as our military ends have been reached.”
To Sir Edward Vochen, British Ambassador
to Germany, he addressed the inquiry: “Is it
the purpose of your country to make war upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Germany for the sake of a scrap of paper?”
The treaty of 1839-1870 guaranteeing Belgium’s
neutrality was the scrap of paper.</p>

<p>With the entrance of England into the war,
the issue between autocracy and democracy
was made plain before the people of the world.
Austria, and later Turkey, joined with Germany;
France, and Japan, by reason of their
respective treaty obligations joined England
and Russia. Italy for the time preferred to
remain neutral, ignoring her implied alliance
with the Teutonic empires. How other nations
lined up on the one side and the other is
indicated by the State Department’s list of war
declarations, and diplomatic severances, which

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<span class="smcap">The Great War Begins</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YEARS before 1914, when Germany declared
war against civilization, it was decided
by the German General Staff to strike at
France through Belgium. The records of the
German Foreign Office prove that fact. The
reason for this lay in the long line of powerful
fortresses along the line that divides France
from Germany and the sparsely spaced and
comparatively out-of-date forts on the border
between Germany and Belgium. True, there
was a treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of
Belgian territory to which Germany was a
signatory party. Some of the clauses of that
treaty were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Article 9. Belgium, within the limits traced in conformity
with the principles laid down in the present preliminaries,
shall form a perpetually neutral state. The
five powers (England, France, Austria, Prussia and
Russia), without wishing to intervene in the internal affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of Belgium, guarantee her that perpetual neutrality
as well as the integrity and inviolability of her territory
in the limits mentioned in the present article.</p>

<p>Article 10. By just reciprocity Belgium shall be held
to observe this same neutrality toward all the other
states and to make no attack on their internal or external
tranquillity while always preserving the right to defend
herself against any foreign aggression.</p>
</div>

<p>This agreement was followed on January
23, 1839, by a definitive treaty, accepted by
Belgium and by the Netherlands, which treaty
regulates Belgium’s neutrality as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Article 7. Belgium, within the limits defined in Articles
1, 2 and 4, shall form an independent and perpetually
neutral state. She is obligated to preserve this
neutrality against all the other states.</p>
</div>

<p>To convert this solemn covenant into a
“scrap of paper” it was necessary that Germany
should find an excuse for tearing it to
pieces. There was absolutely no provocation
in sight, but that did not deter the German
High Command. That august body with no
information whatever to afford an excuse, alleged
in a formal note to the Belgian Government
that the French army intended to invade
Germany through Belgian territory. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
hypocritical and mendacious note and Belgium’s
vigorous reply follow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Note handed in on August 2, 1914, at 7 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,
by Herr von Below-Saleske, German Minister, to M.
Davignon, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, 2d August, 1914.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Imperial German Legation in Belgium</span><br>

(Highly confidential)</p>

<p>The German Government has received reliable information
according to which the French forces intend to
march on the Meuse, by way of Givet and Namur. This
information leaves no doubt as to the intention of France
of marching on Germany through Belgian territory.
The Imperial Government cannot avoid the fear that
Belgium, in spite of its best will, will be in no position
to repulse such a largely developed French march without
aid. In this fact there is sufficient certainty of a
threat directed against Germany.</p>

<p>It is an imperative duty for the preservation of Germany
to forestall this attack of the enemy.</p>

<p>The German Government would feel keen regret if
Belgium should regard as an act of hostility against herself
the fact that the measures of the enemies of Germany
oblige her on her part to violate Belgian territory.</p>

<p>In order to dissipate any misunderstanding the German
Government declares as follows:</p>

<p>1. Germany does not contemplate any act of hostility
against Belgium. If Belgium consents in the war about
to commence to take up an attitude of friendly neutrality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
toward Germany, the German Government on its part
undertakes, on the declaration of peace, to guarantee the
kingdom and its possessions in their whole extent.</p>

<p>2. Germany undertakes under the conditions laid
down to evacuate Belgian territory as soon as peace is
concluded.</p>

<p>3. If Belgium preserves a friendly attitude, Germany
is prepared, in agreement with the authorities of the
Belgian Government, to buy against cash all that is required
by her troops, and to give indemnity for the
damages caused in Belgium.</p>

<p>4. If Belgium behaves in a hostile manner toward the
German troops, and in particular raises difficulties against
their advance by the opposition of the fortifications of
the Meuse, or by destroying roads, railways, tunnels, or
other engineering works, Germany will be compelled to
consider Belgium as an enemy.</p>

<p>In this case Germany will take no engagements toward
Belgium, but she will leave the later settlement of relations
of the two states toward one another to the decision
of arms. The German Government has a justified
hope that this contingency will not arise and that the
Belgian Government will know how to take suitable
measures to hinder its taking place. In this case the
friendly relations which unite the two neighboring states
will become closer and more lasting.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, 3d August, 1914.<br>

(7 o’clock in the morning.) &#160; &#160;</p>

<p>By the note of the 2d August, 1914, the German Government
has made known that according to certain intelligence
the French forces intend to march on the Meuse
via Givet and Namur and that Belgium, in spite of her
good-will, would not be able without help to beat off an
advance of the French troops.</p>

<p>The German Government felt it to be its duty to
forestall this attack and to violate Belgian territory.
Under these conditions Germany proposes to the King’s
Government to take up a friendly attitude, and undertakes
at the moment of peace to guarantee the integrity
of the kingdom and of her possessions in their whole extent.
The note adds that if Belgium raises difficulties
to the forward march of the German troops Germany
will be compelled to consider her as an enemy and to
leave the later settlement of the two states toward one
another to the decision of arms.</p>

<p>This note caused profound and painful surprise to the
King’s Government.</p>

<p>The intentions which it attributed to France are in
contradiction with the express declarations which were
made to us on the 1st of August, in the name of the government
of the republic.</p>

<p>Moreover, if, contrary to our expectation, a violation
of Belgian neutrality were to be committed by France,
Belgium would fulfil all her international duties and her
army would offer the most vigorous opposition to the invader.</p>

<p>The treaties of 1839, confirmed by the treaties of 1870,
establish the independence and the neutrality of Belgium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
under the guarantee of the powers, and particularly of
the Government of his Majesty the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>Belgium has always been faithful to her international
obligations; she has fulfilled her duties in a spirit of
loyal impartiality; she has neglected no effort to maintain
her neutrality or to make it respected.</p>

<p>The attempt against her independence with which the
German Government threatens her would constitute a
flagrant violation of international law. No strategic interest
justifies the violation of that law.</p>

<p>The Belgian government would, by accepting the propositions
which are notified to her, sacrifice the honor
of the nation while at the same time betraying her duties
toward Europe.</p>

<p>Conscious of the part Belgium has played for more
than eighty years in the civilization of the world, she
refuses to believe that the independence of Belgium can
be preserved only at the expense of the violation of her
neutrality.</p>

<p>If this hope were disappointed the Belgian Government
has firmly resolved to repulse by every means in
her power any attack upon her rights.</p>
</div>

<p>The German attack upon Belgium and
France came with terrible force and suddenness.
Twenty-four army corps, divided into
three armies clad in a specially designed and
colored gray-green uniform, swept in three
mighty streams over the German borders with
their objective the heart of France. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Army of the Meuse was given the route
through Liége, Namur and Maubeuge. The
Army of the Moselle violated the Duchy of
Luxemburg, which, under a treaty guaranteeing
its independence and neutrality, was not
permitted to maintain an army. Germany was
a signatory party to this treaty also. The
Army of the Rhine cut through the Vosges
Mountains and its route lay between the
French cities of Nancy and Toul.</p>

<p class="caption">KING ALBERT AT THE HEAD OF THE HEROIC SOLDIERS OF BELGIUM</p>

<p>It is universally agreed that the Belgian monarch was no figurehead general but a real leader of his troops. These were the men who,
facing annihilation, astonished the world by opposing the German military machine successfully enough to allow France to get her
armies into shape and prevent the immediate taking of Paris that was planned by Germany.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The heroic defense of the Belgian army at
Liége against the Army of the Meuse delayed
the operation of Germany’s plans and in all
probability saved Paris. It was the first of
many similar disappointments and checks that
Germany encountered during the war.</p>

<p>The defense of Liége continued for ten
heroic days. Within that interval the first
British Expeditionary Forces were landed in
France and Belgium, the French army was
mobilized to full strength. The little Belgian
army falling back northward on Antwerp,
Louvain and Brussels, threatened the German
flank and approximately 200,000 German soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
were compelled to remain in the conquered
section of Belgium to garrison it effectively.</p>

<p>Liége fortifications were the design of the
celebrated strategist Brialmont. They consisted
of twelve isolated fortresses which had
been permitted to become out of repair. No
field works of any kind connected them and
they were without provision for defense against
encircling tactics and against modern artillery.</p>

<p>The huge 42-centimeter guns, the first of
Germany’s terrible surprises, were brought
into action against these forts, and their concrete
and armored steel turrets were cracked
as walnuts are cracked between the jaws of a
nut-cracker. The Army of the Meuse then
made its way like a gray-green cloud of poison
gas through Belgium. A cavalry screen of
crack Uhlan regiments preceded it, and it
made no halt worthy of note until it confronted
the Belgian army on the line running from
Louvain to Namur. The Belgians were
forced back before Louvain on August 20th,
the Belgian Government removed the capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
from Brussels to Antwerp, and the German
hosts entered evacuated Brussels.</p>

<p>During this advance of the Army of the
Meuse, strong French detachments invaded
German soil, pouring into Alsace through the
Belfort Gap. Brief successes attended the
bold stroke. Mûlhausen was captured and
the Metz-Strassburg Railroad was cut in several
places. The French suffered a defeat almost
immediately following this first flush of
victory, both in Alsace and in Lorraine, where
a French detachment had engaged with the
Army of the Moselle. The French army
thereupon retreated to the strong line of forts
and earthworks defending the border between
France and Germany.</p>

<p>England’s first expeditionary force landed
at Ostend, Calais and Dunkirk on August
7th. It was dubbed England’s “contemptible
little army” by the German General Staff.
That name was seized upon gladly by England
as a spur to volunteering. It brought to
the surface national pride and a fierce determination
to compel Germany to recognize and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
to reckon with the “contemptible little army.”</p>

<p>The contact between the French, Belgian
and British forces was speedily established and
something like concert resistance to the advance
of the enemy was made possible. The
German army, however, followed by a huge
equipment of motor kitchens, munition trains,
and other motor transport evidencing great
care in preparation for the movement, swept
resistlessly forward until it encountered the
French and British on a line running from
Mons to Charleroi.</p>

<p>The British army was assigned to a position
between two French armies. By some
miscalculation, the French army that was to
have taken its position on the British left,
never appeared. The French army on the
right was attacked and defeated at Charleroi,
falling back in some confusion. The German
Army of the Moselle co-operating with the
Army of the Meuse then attacked the British
and French, and a great flanking movement
by the German joint commands developed.</p>

<p>This was directed mainly at the British under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
command of Sir John French. There followed
a retreat that for sheer heroism and
dogged determination has become one of the
great battles of all time. The British, outflanked
and outnumbered three to one, fought
and marched without cessation for six days
and nights. Time after time envelopment and
disaster threatened them, but with a determination
that would not be beaten they fought off
the best that Germany could send against them,
maintained contact with the French army on
their right, and delayed the German advance
so effectively that a complete disarrangement
of all the German plans ensued. This was the
second great disappointment to Germany. It
made possible the victory of the Marne and
the victorious peace of 1918. The story of
that immortal retreat is best told in the words
of Sir John French, transmitting the report
of this encounter to the British War Office.
It follows:</p>

<p>“The transport of the troops from England
both by sea and by rail was effected in the best
order and without a check. Each unit arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
at its destination well within the scheduled time.</p>

<p>“The concentration was practically complete
on the evening of Friday, the 21st ultimo, and
I was able to make dispositions to move the
force during Saturday, the 22d, to positions
I considered most favorable from which to
commence operations which the French commander-in-chief,
General Joffre, requested me
to undertake in pursuance of his plans in prosecution
of the campaign.</p>

<p>“The line taken up extended along the line
of the canal from Condé on the west, through
Mons and Binche on the east. This line was
taken up as follows:</p>

<p>“From Condé to Mons, inclusive, was assigned
to the Second Corps, and to the right of
the Second Corps from Mons the First Corps
was posted. The Fifth Cavalry Brigade was
placed at Binche.</p>

<p>“In the absence of my Third Army Corps
I desired to keep the cavalry divisions as much
as possible as a reserve to act on my outer
flank, or move in support of any threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
part of the line. The forward reconnoissance
was intrusted to Brig. Gen. Sir Philip Chetwode,
with the Fifth Cavalry Brigade, but I
directed General Allenby to send forward a
few squadrons to assist in this work.</p>

<p>“During the 22d and 23d these advanced
squadrons did some excellent work, some of
them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several
encounters took place in which our troops
showed to great advantage.</p>

<p>“2. At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, on August 23d, I assembled
the commanders of the First and Second Corps
and cavalry division at a point close to the
position and explained the general situation
of the Allies, and what I understood to be
General Joffre’s plan. I discussed with them
at some length the immediate situation in front
of us.</p>

<p>“From information I received from French
headquarters I understood that little more
than one, or at most two, of the enemy’s army
corps, with perhaps one cavalry division, were
in front of my position; and I was aware of
no attempted outflanking movement by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
enemy. I was confirmed in this opinion by
the fact that my patrols encountered no undue
opposition in their reconnoitering operations.
The observations of my airplanes
seemed to bear out this estimate.</p>

<p>“About 3 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> on Sunday, the 23d, reports
began coming in to the effect that the enemy
was commencing an attack on the Mons line,
apparently in some strength, but that the right
of the position from Mons and Bray was being
particularly threatened.</p>

<p>“The commander of the First Corps had
pushed his flank back to some high ground
south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade
evacuated Binche, moving slightly south; the
enemy thereupon occupied Binche.</p>

<p>“The right of the Third Division, under
General Hamilton, was at Mons, which formed
a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed
the commander of the Second Corps to be
careful not to keep the troops on this salient
too long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw
back the center behind Mons. This was done
before dark. In the meantime, about 5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
I received a most unexpected message from
General Joffre by telegraph, telling me that
at least three German corps, viz., a reserve
corps, the Fourth Corps and the Ninth Corps,
were moving on my position in front, and
that the Second Corps was engaged in a turning
movement from the direction of Tournay.
He also informed me that the two reserve
French divisions and the Fifth French Army
on my right were retiring, the Germans having
on the previous day gained possession of
the passages of the Sambre, between Charleroi
and Namur.</p>

<p>“3. In view of the possibility of my being
driven from the Mons position, I had previously
ordered a position in rear to be reconnoitered.
This position rested on the fortress
of Maubeuge on the right and extended west
to Jenlain, southwest to Valenciennes, on the
left. The position was reported difficult to
hold, because standing crops and buildings
made the placing of trenches very difficult and
limited the field of fire in many important localities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
It nevertheless afforded a few good
artillery positions.</p>

<p>“When the news of the retirement of the
French and the heavy German threatening on
my front reached me, I endeavored to confirm
it by airplane reconnoissance; and as a
result of this I determined to effect a retirement
to the Maubeuge position at daybreak
on the 24th.</p>

<p>“A certain amount of fighting continued
along the whole line throughout the night and
at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division
from the neighborhood of Harmignies made
a powerful demonstration as if to retake
Binche. This was supported by the artillery
of both the First and Second Divisions, while
the First Division took up a supporting position
in the neighborhood of Peissant. Under
cover of this demonstration the Second Corps
retired on the line Dour-Quaroule-Framéries.
The Third Division on the right of the corps
suffered considerable loss in this operation from
the enemy, who had retaken Mons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“The Second Corps halted on this line,
where they partially intrenched themselves, enabling
Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps
gradually to withdraw to the new position;
and he effected this without much further loss,
reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Toward midday the enemy appeared
to be directing his principal effort against our
left.</p>

<p>“I had previously ordered General Allenby
with the cavalry to act vigorously in advance
of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure
off.</p>

<p>“About 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> General Allenby received
a message from Sir Charles Ferguson, commanding
the Fifth Division, saying that he was
very hard pressed and in urgent need of support.
On receipt of this message General Allenby
drew in the cavalry and endeavored to
bring direct support to the Fifth Division.</p>

<p>“During the course of this operation General
De Lisle, of the Second Cavalry Brigade,
thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze
the further advance of the enemy’s infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
by making a mounted attack on his flank. He
formed up and advanced for this purpose, but
was held up by wire about five hundred yards
from his objective, and the Ninth Lancers and
the Eighteenth Hussars suffered severely in
the retirement of the brigade.</p>

<p>“The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which
had been guarding the line of communications,
was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the
22d and 23d. On the morning of the 24th they
were moved out to a position south of Quarouble
to support the left flank of the Second
Corps.</p>

<p>“With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace
Smith-Dorrien was enabled to effect his
retreat to a new position; although, having
two corps of the enemy on his front and one
threatening his flank, he suffered great losses
in doing so.</p>

<p>“At nightfall the position was occupied by
the Second Corps to the west of Bavai, the
First Corps to the right. The right was protected
by the Fortress of Maubeuge, the left
by the Nineteenth Brigade in position between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Jenlain and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer
flank.</p>

<p>“4. The French were still retiring, and I had
no support except such as was afforded by
the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined
attempts of the enemy to get round my
left flank assured me that it was his intention
to hem me against that place and surround me.
I felt that not a moment must be lost in retiring
to another position.</p>

<p>“I had every reason to believe that the
enemy’s forces were somewhat exhausted and
I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I
hoped, therefore, that his pursuit would not be
too vigorous to prevent me effecting my object.</p>

<p>“The operation, however, was full of danger
and difficulty, not only owing to the very
superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion
of the troops.</p>

<p>“The retirement was recommenced in the
early morning of the 25th to a position in the
neighborhood of Le Cateau, and rear guards
were ordered to be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eih
Road by 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></span></p>

<p>“Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional
cavalry of the Second Corps, covered the
movement of the Second Corps. The remainder
of the cavalry division, with the Nineteenth
Brigade, the whole under the command
of General Allenby, covered the west flank.</p>

<p>“The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment
at Le Cateau on Sunday, the 23d,
and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions
and a brigade of artillery with divisional
staff were available for service.</p>

<p>“I ordered General Snow to move out to
take up a position with his right south of
Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-Le
Cateau Road south of La Chaprie. In this
position the division rendered great help to
the effective retirement of the Second and
First Corps to the new position.</p>

<p>“Although the troops had been ordered to
occupy the Cambrai-Le Cateau-Landrecies position,
and the ground had, during the 25th,
been partially prepared and intrenched, I had
grave doubts, owing to the information I had
received as to the accumulating strength of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the enemy against me—as to the wisdom of
standing there to fight.</p>

<p>“Having regard to the continued retirement
of the French on my right, my exposed left
flank, the tendency of the enemy’s western
corps (II) to envelope me, and, more than all,
the exhausted condition of the troops, I determined
to make a great effort to continue the
retreat until I could put some substantial obstacle,
such as the Somme or the Oise, between
my troops and the enemy, and afford the former
some opportunity of rest and reorganization.
Orders were, therefore, sent to the
corps commanders to continue their retreat as
soon as they possibly could toward the general
line Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.</p>

<p>“The cavalry under General Allenby, were
ordered to cover the retirement.</p>

<p>“Throughout the 25th and far into the evening,
the First Corps continued its march on
Landrecies, following the road along the eastern
border of the Forêt de Mormal, and arrived
at Landrecies about 10 o’clock. I had
intended that the corps should come further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
west so as to fill up the gap between Le Cateau
and Landrecies, but the men were exhausted
and could not get further in without rest.</p>

<p>“The enemy, however, would not allow them
this rest, and about 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> a report was received
that the Fourth Guards Brigade in
Landrecies was heavily attacked by troops of
the Ninth German Army Corps, who were
coming through the forest on the north of the
town. This brigade fought most gallantly,
and caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss
in issuing from the forest into the narrow
streets of the town. This loss has been estimated
from reliable sources at from 700 to
1,000. At the same time information reached
me from Sir Douglas Haig that his First Division
was also heavily engaged south and east
of Maroilles. I sent urgent messages to the
commander of the two French reserve divisions
on my right to come up to the assistance
of the First Corps, which they eventually did.
Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to
the skillful manner in which Sir Douglas Haig
extricated his corps from an exceptionally difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
position in the darkness of the night,
they were able at dawn to resume their march
south toward Wassigny on Guise.</p>

<p>“By about 6 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> the Second Corps had got
into position with their right on Le Cateau,
their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and
the line of defense was continued thence by the
Fourth Division toward Seranvillers, the left
being thrown back.</p>

<p>“During the fighting on the 24th and 25th
the cavalry became a good deal scattered, but
by the early morning of the 26th, General Allenby
had succeeded in concentrating two brigades
to the south of Cambrai.</p>

<p>“The Fourth Division was placed under the
orders of the general officer commanding the
Second Army Corps.</p>

<p>“On the 24th the French cavalry corps, consisting
of three divisions under General Sordêt,
had been in billets north of Avesnes. On
my way back from Bavai, which was my ‘Poste
de Commandement’ during the fighting of the
23d and 24th, I visited General Sordêt, and
earnestly requested his co-operation and support.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
He promised to obtain sanction from
his army commander to act on my left flank,
but said that his horses were too tired to move
before the next day. Although he rendered
me valuable assistance later on in the course
of the retirement, he was unable, for the reasons
given, to afford me any support on the
most critical day of all, viz., the 26th.</p>

<p>“At daybreak it became apparent that the
enemy was throwing the bulk of his strength
against the left of the position occupied by the
Second Corps and the Fourth Division.</p>

<p>“At this time the guns of four German army
corps were in position against them, and Sir
Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that
he judged it impossible to continue his retirement
at daybreak (as ordered) in face of such
an attack.</p>

<p>“I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors
to break off the action and retire at
the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible
for me to send him any support, the First
Corps being at the moment incapable of movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“The French Cavalry Corps, under General
Sordêt, was coming up on our left rear early
in the morning, and I sent an urgent message
to him to do his utmost to come up and support
the retirement of my left flank; but owing
to the fatigue of his horses he found himself
unable to intervene in any way.</p>

<p>“There had been no time to intrench the
position properly, but the troops showed a
magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted
them.</p>

<p>“The artillery, although outmatched by at
least four to one, made a splendid fight, and
inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.</p>

<p>“At length it became apparent that, if complete
annihilation was to be avoided, a retirement
must be attempted; and the order was
given to commence it about 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> The
movement was covered with the most devoted
intrepidity and determination by the artillery,
which had itself suffered heavily, and the fine
work done by the cavalry in the further retreat
from the position assisted materially in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
final completion of this most difficult and dangerous
operation.</p>

<p>“Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered
too heavily to engage in an energetic pursuit.</p>

<p>“I cannot close the brief account of this
glorious stand of the British troops without
putting on record my deep appreciation of
the valuable services rendered by Gen. Sir
Horace Smith-Dorrien.</p>

<p>“I say without hesitation that the saving of
the left wing of the army under my command
on the morning of the 26th of August, could
never have been accomplished unless a commander
of rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity,
and determination had been present to personally
conduct the operation.</p>

<p>“The retreat was continued far into the
night of the 26th and through the 27th and
28th, on which date the troops halted on the
line Noyon-Chauny-La Fère, having then
thrown off the weight of the enemy’s pursuit.</p>

<p>“On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to General Sordêt and the French cavalry division
which he commands for materially assisting
my retirement and successfully driving
back some of the enemy on Cambrai.</p>

<p>“General D’Amade also, with the Sixty-first
and Sixty-second French Reserve Divisions,
moved down from the neighborhood of Arras
on the enemy’s right flank and took much pressure
off the rear of the British forces.</p>

<p>“This closes the period covering the heavy
fighting which commenced at Mons on Sunday
afternoon, 23d August, and which really
constituted a four days’ battle.</p>

<p>“At this point, therefore, I propose to close
the present dispatch.</p>

<p>“I deeply deplore the very serious losses
which the British forces have suffered in this
great battle; but they were inevitable in view
of the fact that the British army—only two
days after a concentration by rail—was called
upon to withstand a vigorous attack of five
Germany army corps.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“It is impossible for me to speak too highly
of the skill evinced by the two general officers
commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing
and devoted exertions of their staffs; the direction
of the troops by divisional, brigade, and
regimental leaders; the command of the smaller
units by their officers; and the magnificent
fighting spirit displayed by non-commissioned
officers and men.</p>

<p>“I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship’s
notice the admirable work done by the
Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson.
Their skill, energy, and perseverance
have been beyond all praise. They have furnished
me with the most complete and accurate
information, which has been of incalculable
value in the conduct of the operations.
Fired at constantly both by friend and foe,
and not hesitating to fly in every kind of
weather, they have remained undaunted
throughout.</p>

<p>“Further, by actually fighting in the air, they
have succeeded in destroying five of the
enemy’s machines.”</p>

<p>The combined French and British armies,
including the forces that had retreated from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Alsace and Lorraine, gave way with increasing
stubbornness before von Kluck. That
German general disregarding the fortresses
surrounding Paris, swung southward to make
a junction with the Army of the Crown Prince
of Germany advancing through the Vosges
Mountains. General Manoury’s army opposed
the German advance on the entrenched
line of Paris. General Gallieni commanding
the garrison of Paris, was ready with a novel
mobile transport consisting of taxicabs and
fast trucks. The total number of soldiers in
the French and British armies now outnumbered
those in the German armies opposed to
them.</p>

<p>General Joffre, in supreme command of the
French, had chosen the battleground. He had
set the trap with consummate skill. The word
was given; the trap was sprung; and the first
battle of the Marne came as a crashing surprise
to Germany.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Trail of the Beast in Belgium</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GERMANY’S onrush into heroic Belgium
speedily resolved itself into a saturnalia
that drenched the land with blood and roused
the civilized world into resentful horror.
As the tide of barbarity swept forward
into Northern France, stories of the horrors
filtered through the close web of German censorship.
There were denials at first by German
propagandists. In the face of truth furnished
by thousands of witnesses, the denials
faded away.</p>

<p>What caused these atrocities? Were they
the spontaneous expression of dormant brutishness
in German soldiers? Were they a sudden
reversion of an entire nation to bestiality?</p>

<p>The answer is that the private soldier as an
individual was not responsible. The carnage,
the rapine, the wholesale desolation was an integral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
part of the German policy of <i>schrecklichkeit</i>
or frightfulness. This policy was laid
down by Germany as part of its imperial war
code. In 1902 Germany issued a new war
manual entitled “Kriegsbrauch im Landkriege.”
In it is written this cold-blooded declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All measures which conduce to the attainment of the
object of war are permissible and these may be summarized
in the two ideas of violence and cunning. What
is permissible includes every means of war without which
the object of the war cannot be attained. All means
which modern invention affords, including the fullest,
most dangerous, and most massive means of destruction,
may be utilized.</p>
</div>

<p>Brand Whitlock, United States Minister to
Belgium, in a formal report to the State Department,
made this statement concerning
Germany’s policy in permitting these outrages:</p>

<p>“All these deliberate organized massacres of
civilians, all these murders and outrages, the
violation of women, the killing of children,
wanton destruction, burning, looting and pillage,
and whole towns destroyed, were acts for
which no possible military necessity can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
pleaded. They were wilfully committed as
part of a deliberately prepared and scientifically
organized policy of terrorism.”</p>

<p>And now, having considered these outrages
as part of the German policy of terrorism, let
us turn to the facts presented by those who
made investigations at first hand in devastated
Belgium and Northern France.</p>

<p>Let us first return to the tragic story of the
destruction of Louvain. The first document
comes in the form of a cable sent from the Belgian
Minister of Foreign Affairs under date of
August 8, 1914:</p>

<p>“On Tuesday evening a body of German
troops who had been driven back retired in
disorder upon the town of Louvain. Germans
who were guarding the town thought that the
retiring troops were Belgians and fired upon
them. In order to excuse this mistake the
Germans, in spite of the most energetic denials
on the part of the authorities, pretended that
Belgians had fired on the Germans, although
all the inhabitants, including policemen, had
been disarmed for more than a week. Without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
any examination and without listening to
any protest the commanding officer announced
that the town would be immediately destroyed.
All inhabitants had to leave their homes at
once; some were made prisoners; women and
children were put into a train of which the destination
was unknown; soldiers with fire bombs
set fire to the different quarters of the town;
the splendid Church of St. Pierre, the markets,
the university and its scientific establishments,
were given to the flames, and it is probable that
the Hotel de Ville, this celebrated jewel of
Gothic art, will also have disappeared in the
disaster. Several notabilities were shot at
sight. Thus a town of 40,000 inhabitants,
which, since the fifteenth century, has been the
intellectual and scientific capital of the Low
Countries, is a heap of ashes. Americans,
many of whom have followed the course at
this illustrious alma mater and have there received
such cordial hospitality, cannot remain
insensible to this outrage on the rights of humanity
and civilization which is unprecedented
in history.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Minister Whitlock made the following report
on the same outrage:</p>

<p>“A violent fusillade broke out simultaneously
at various points in the city (Louvain),
notably at the Porte de Bruxelles, Porte de
Tirlemont, Rue Leopold, Rue Marie-Thérèse,
Rue des Joyeuses Entrées. German soldiers
were firing at random in every street and in
every direction. Later fires broke out everywhere,
notably in the University building, the
Library, in the old Church of St. Peter, in the
Place du Peuple, in the Rue de la Station, in
the Boulevard de Tirlemont, and in the
Chaussée de Tirlemont. On the orders of
their chiefs, the German soldiers would break
open the houses and set fire to them, shooting
on the inhabitants who tried to leave their
dwellings. Many persons who took refuge in
their cellars were burned to death. The German
soldiers were equipped with apparatus
for the purpose of firing dwellings, incendiary
pastils, machines for spraying petroleum,
etc....</p>

<p>“Major von Manteuffel (of the German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
forces) sent for Alderman Schmidt. Upon
the latter’s arrival, the major declared that
hostages were to be held, as sedition had just
broken out. He asked Father Parijs, Mr.
Schmidt, and Mgr. Coenraedts, First Vice-Rector
of the University, who was being held
as a hostage, to make proclamations to the
inhabitants exhorting them to be calm and
menacing them with a fine of twenty million
francs, the destruction of the city and the hanging
of the hostages, if they created disturbance.
Surrounded by about thirty soldiers and a few
officers, Major Manteuffel, Father Parijs, Mr.
Schmidt and Mgr. Coenraedts left in the direction
of the station, and the alderman, in
French, and the priest, in Flemish, made proclamations
at the street corners....</p>

<p>“Near the statue of Juste-Lipse, a Dr.
Berghausen, a German surgeon, in a highly excited
condition, ran to meet the delegation.
He shouted that a German soldier had just
been killed by a shot fired from the house of
Mr. David Fishbach. Addressing the soldiers,
Dr. Berghausen said: ‘The blood of the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
population of Louvain is not worth a drop
of the blood of a German soldier!’ Then one
of the soldiers threw into the interior of the
house of Mr. Fishbach one of the pastils which
the German soldiers carried and immediately
the house flared up. It contained paintings
of a high value. The old coachman, Joseph
Vandermosten, who had re-entered the house
to try to save the life of his master, did not return.
His body was found the next day
amidst the ruins....</p>

<p>“The Germans made the usual claim that
the civil population had fired upon them and
that it was necessary to take these measures,
i. e., burn the churches, the library and other
public monuments, burn and pillage houses,
driving out and murdering the inhabitants,
sacking the city in order to punish and to
spread terror among the people, and General
von Luttwitz had told me that it was reported
that the son of the burgomaster had shot one
of their generals.</p>

<p>“But the burgomaster of Louvain had no son,
and no officer was shot at Louvain. The story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of a general shot by the son of a burgomaster
was a repetition of a tragedy that had occurred
at Aerschot, on the 19th, where the fifteen-year-old
son of the burgomaster had been killed by
a firing squad, not because he had shot a general,
but because an officer had been shot,
probably by Belgian soldiers retreating
through the town. The story of this tragedy
is told by the boy’s mother, under oath, before
the Belgian Commission, and is so simple, so
touching, so convincing in its verisimilitude,
that I attach a copy of it in extenso to this
report. It seems to afford an altogether typical
example of what went on all over the
stricken land during those days of terror. (In
other places it was the daughter of the burgomaster
who was said to have shot a general.)</p>

<p>“The following facts may be noted: From
the avowal of Prussian officers themselves,
there was not one single victim, among their
men at the barracks of St. Martin, Louvain,
where it was claimed that the first shot had
been fired from a house situated in front of
the Caserne. This would appear to be impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
had the civilians fired upon them point
blank from across the street. It was said that
when certain houses near the barracks were
burning, numerous explosions occurred, revealing
the presence of cartridges; but these
houses were drinking houses much frequented
by German soldiers. It was said that Spanish
students shot from the schools in the Rue
de la Station, but Father Catala, rector of the
school, affirms that the schools were empty....</p>

<p>“If it was necessary, for whatever reason, to
do what was done at Vise, at Dinant, at Aerschot,
at Louvain, and in a hundred other towns
that were sacked, pillaged and burned, where
masses were shot down because civilians had
fired on German troops, and if it was necessary
to do this on a scale never before witnessed
in history, one might not unreasonably
assume that the alleged firing by civilians was
done on a scale, if not so thoroughly organized,
at least somewhat in proportion to the
rage of destruction that punished it. And
hence it would seem to be a simple matter to
produce at least convincing evidence that civilians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
had fired on the soldiers; but there is
no testimony to that effect beyond that of the
soldiers who merely assert it: <i>Man hat geschossen</i>.
If there were no more firing on soldiers
by civilians in Belgium than is proved by
the German testimony, it was not enough to
justify the burning of the smallest of the towns
that was overtaken by that fate. And there is
not a scintilla of evidence of organized bands of
francs-tireurs, such as were found in the war
of 1870.”</p>

<p class="caption">GERMAN ATROCITIES</p>

<p>At Senlis, Department of Oise, on September 2, 1914, French captives were made to walk in the open so as to be hit by French
bullets. Many were killed and wounded. The townsman on the left was struck in the knee. A German officer asked to see the wound
and shot him through the shoulder. On the right a German officer is seen torturing a wounded French soldier by beating him in the
face with a stick.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Under date of September 12, 1917, Minister
Whitlock, in a report to the State Department
of the United States, made the following
summary: “As one studies the evidence
at hand, one is struck at the outset by
the fact so general that it must exclude the
hypothesis of coincidence, and that is that these
wholesale massacres followed immediately
upon some check, some reverse, that the German
army had sustained. The German army
was checked by the guns of the forts to the
east of Liége, and the horrors of Vise, Verviers,
Bligny, Battice, Hervy and twenty villages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
follow. When they entered Liége, they
burned the houses along two streets and killed
many persons, five or six Spaniards among
them. Checked before Namur they sacked
Andenne, Bauvignies, and Champignon, and
when they took Namur they burned one hundred
and fifty houses. Compelled to give battle
to the French army in the Belgian Ardennes
they ravaged the beautiful valley of the
Semois; the complete destruction of the village
of Rossignlo and the extermination of its entire
male population took place there.
Checked again by the French on the Meuse,
the awful carnage of Dinant results. Held on
the Sambre by the French, they burn one hundred
houses at Charleroi and enact the appalling
tragedy of Tamines. At Mons, the English
hold them, and after that all over the
Borinage there is a systematic destruction, pillage
and murder. The Belgian army drive
them back from Malines and Louvain is
doomed. The Belgian army falling back and
fighting in retreat took refuge in the forts of
Antwerp, and the burning and sack of Hougaerde,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Wavre, Ottignies, Grimde, Neerlinter,
Weert, St. George, Shaffen and Aerschot follow.</p>

<p>“The Belgian troops inflicted serious losses
on the Germans in the South of the Province of
Limbourg and the towns of Lummen, Bilsen,
and Lanaeken are partially destroyed. Antwerp
held out for two months, and all about
its outer line of fortifications there was blood
and fire, numerous villages were sacked and
burned and the whole town of Termonde was
destroyed. During the battles of September
the village of Boortmeerbeek near Malines,
occupied by the Germans, was retaken by the
Belgians, and when the Germans entered it
again they burned forty houses. Three times
occupied by the Belgians and retaken by the
Germans Boortmeerbeek was three times punished
in the same way. That is to say, everywhere
the German army met with a defeat it
took it out, as we say in America, on the civil
population. And that is the explanation of
the German atrocities in Belgium.”</p>

<p>A committee of the highest honor and responsibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
was appointed by the British Government
to investigate the whole subject of
atrocities in Belgium and Northern France.
Its chairman was the Rt. Hon. Viscount James
Bryce, formerly British Ambassador to the
United States. Its other members were the
Rt. Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, the Rt. Hon.
Sir Edward Clark, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, Mr.
H. A. L. Fisher, Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Sheffield, Mr. Harold Cox and Sir
Kenelm E. Digby.</p>

<p>The report of the commission bears upon its
face the stamp of painstaking search for truth,
substantiates every statement made by Minister
Whitlock and makes known many horrible
instances of cruelty and barbarity. It
makes the following deductions as having been
proved beyond question:</p>

<p>1. That there were in many parts of Belgium
deliberate and systematically organized
massacres of the civil population, accompanied
by many isolated murders and other outrages.</p>

<p>2. That in the conduct of the war generally
innocent civilians, both men and women, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
murdered in large numbers, women violated,
and children murdered.</p>

<p>3. That looting, house burning, and the
wanton destruction of property were ordered
and countenanced by the officers of the German
army, that elaborate provision had been made
for systematic incendiarism at the very outbreak
of the war, and that the burnings and destruction
were frequent where no military necessity
could be alleged, being, indeed, part of
a system of general terrorization.</p>

<p>4. That the rules and usages of war were
frequently broken, particularly by the using
of civilians, including women and children, as
a shield for advancing forces exposed to fire, to
a less degree by killing the wounded and prisoners
and in the frequent abuse of the Red
Cross and the white flag.</p>

<p>The Bryce Commission’s report on the destruction
of Dinant is an example of testimony
laid before them. It follows:</p>

<p>“A clear statement of the outrages at Dinant,
which many travelers will recall as a
singularly picturesque town on the Meuse, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
given by one witness, who says that the Germans
began burning houses in the Rue St.
Jacques on the 21st of August, and that every
house in the street was burned. On the following
day an engagement took place between
the French and the Germans, and the witness
spent the whole day in the cellar of a bank
with his wife and children. On the morning of
the 23d, about 5 o’clock, firing ceased, and almost
immediately afterward a party of Germans
came to the house. They rang the bell
and began to batter at the door and windows.
The witness’ wife went to the door and two or
three Germans came in. The family were ordered
out into the street. There they found
another family, and the two families were
driven with their hands above their heads along
the Rue Grande. All the houses in the street
were burning.</p>

<p>“The party was eventually put into a forge
where there were a number of other prisoners,
about a hundred in all, and were kept there
from 11 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> till 2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> They were then
taken to the prison. There they were assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
in a courtyard and searched. No arms
were found. They were then passed through
into the prison itself and put into cells. The
witness and his wife were separated from each
other. During the next hour the witness heard
rifle shots continually and noticed in the corner
of a courtyard leading off the row of cells the
body of a young man with a mantle thrown
over it. He recognized the mantle as having
belonged to his wife. The witness’ daughter
was allowed to go out to see what had happened
to her mother, and the witness himself
was allowed to go across the courtyard half an
hour afterward for the same purpose. He
found his wife lying on the floor in a room.
She had bullet wounds in four places but was
alive and told her husband to return to the
children and he did so.</p>

<p>“About 5 o’clock in the evening, he saw the
Germans bringing out all the young and middle-aged
men from the cells, and ranging their
prisoners, to the number of forty, in three rows
in the middle of the courtyard. About twenty
Germans were drawn up opposite, but before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
anything was done there was a tremendous
fusillade from some point near the prison and
the civilians were hurried back to their cells.
Half an hour later the same forty men were
brought back into the courtyard. Almost immediately
there was a second fusillade like the
first and they were driven back to the cells
again.</p>

<p>“About 7 o’clock the witness and other prisoners
were brought out of their cells and
marched out of the prison. They went between
two lines of troops to Roche Bayard,
about a kilometer away. An hour later the
women and children were separated and the
prisoners were brought back to Dinant passing
the prison on their way. Just outside the
prison, the witness saw three lines of bodies
which he recognized as being those of his neighbors.
They were nearly all dead, but he noticed
movement in some of them. There were
about one hundred and twenty bodies. The
prisoners were then taken up to the top of a
hill outside Dinant and compelled to stay there
till 8 o’clock in the morning. On the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
day they were put into cattle trucks and taken
thence to Coblenz. For three months they remained
prisoners in Germany.</p>

<p>“Unarmed civilians were killed in masses at
other places near the prison. About ninety
bodies were seen lying on the top of one another
in a grass square opposite the convent. A witness
asked a German officer why her husband
had been shot, and he told her that it was because
two of her sons had been in the civil guard
and had shot at the Germans. As a matter of
fact, one of her sons was at that time in Liége
and the other in Brussels. It is stated that
besides the ninety corpses referred to above,
sixty corpses of civilians were recovered from
a hole in the brewery yard and that forty-eight
bodies of women and children were found in a
garden. The town was systematically set on
fire by hand grenades. Another witness saw a
little girl of seven, one of whose legs was
broken and the other injured by a bayonet.
We have no reason to believe that the civilian
population of Dinant gave any provocation, or
that any other defense can be put forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
justify the treatment inflicted upon its citizens.”</p>

<p>The Bryce Commission reports the outrages
in a number of Belgian villages in this terse
fashion:</p>

<p>“In Hofstade a number of houses had been
set on fire and many corpses were seen, some
in houses, some in back yards, and some in the
streets. Two witnesses speak of having seen
the body of a young man pierced by bayonet
thrusts with the wrists cut also. On a side road
the corpse of a civilian was seen on his doorstep
with a bayonet wound in his stomach and
by his side the dead body of a boy of five or six
with his hands nearly severed. The corpses of
a woman and boy were seen at the blacksmith’s.
They had been killed with the bayonet. In a
café, a young man, also killed with the bayonet,
was holding his hands together as if in the attitude
of supplication.</p>

<p>“In the garden of a house in the main street,
bodies of two women were observed, and in another
house, the body of a boy of sixteen with
two bayonet wounds in the chest. In Sempst a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
similar condition of affairs existed. Houses
were burning and in some of them were the
charred remains of civilians. In a bicycle shop
a witness saw the burned corpse of a man.
Other witnesses speak of this incident. Another
civilian, unarmed, was shot as he was running
away. As will be remembered, all the
arms had been given up some time before by
the order of the burgomaster.</p>

<p>“At Weerde four corpses of civilians were
lying in the road. It was said that these men
had fired upon the German soldiers; but this is
denied. The arms had been given up long
before. Two children were killed in the village
of Weerde, quite wantonly as they were standing
in the road with their mother. They were
three or four years old and were killed with
the bayonet. A small barn burning close by
formed a convenient means of getting rid of
the bodies. They were thrown into the flames
from the bayonets. It is right to add that no
commissioned officer was present at the time.
At Eppeghem, on August 25th, a pregnant
woman who had been wounded with a bayonet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
was discovered in the convent. She was dying.
On the road six dead bodies of laborers were
seen.</p>

<p>“At Boortmeerbeek a German soldier was
seen to fire three times at a little girl five years
old. Having failed to hit her, he subsequently
bayoneted her. He was killed with the butt
end of a rifle by a Belgian soldier who had
seen him commit this murder from a distance.
At Herent the charred body of a civilian was
found in a butcher’s shop, and in a handcart
twenty yards away was the dead body of a
laborer. Two eye witnesses relate that a German
soldier shot a civilian and stabbed him
with a bayonet as he lay. He then made one
of these witnesses, a civilian prisoner, smell
the blood on the bayonet. At Haecht the bodies
of ten civilians were seen lying in a row by
a brewery wall. In a laborer’s house, which
had been broken up, the mutilated corpse of a
woman of thirty to thirty-five was discovered.”</p>

<p>Concerning the treatment of women and
children in general, the report continues:
“The evidence shows that the German authorities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
when carrying out a policy of systematic
arson and plunder in selected districts, usually
drew some distinction between the adult
male population on the one hand and the
women and children on the other. It was a
frequent practice to set apart the adult males
of the condemned district with a view to the
execution of a suitable number—preferably
of the younger and more vigorous—and to reserve
the women and children for milder treatment.
The depositions, however, present
many instances of calculated cruelty, often going
the length of murder, toward the women
and children of the condemned area.</p>

<p>“At Dinant sixty women and children were
confined in the cellar of a convent from Sunday
morning till the following Friday, August
28th, sleeping on the ground, for there
were no beds, with nothing to drink during the
whole period, and given no food until Wednesday,
when somebody threw into the cellar
two sticks of macaroni and a carrot for each
prisoner. In other cases the women and children
were marched for long distances along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
roads, as, for instance, the march of the women
from Louvain to Tirlemont, August 28th, the
laggards pricked on by the attendant Uhlans.
A lady complains of having been brutally
kicked by privates. Others were struck at
with the butt end of rifles. At Louvain, at
Liége, at Aerschot, at Malines, at Montigny, at
Andenne, and elsewhere, there is evidence that
the troops were not restrained from drunkenness,
and drunken soldiers cannot be trusted
to observe the rules or decencies of war, least of
all when they are called upon to execute a preordained
plan of arson and pillage. From the
very first women were not safe. At Liége
women and children were chased about the
streets by soldiers.</p>

<p>“Witnesses recount how a great crowd of
men, women and children from Aerschot were
marched to Louvain, and then suddenly exposed
to a fire from a mitrailleuse and rifles.
‘We were all placed,’ recounts a sufferer, ‘in
Station Street, Louvain, and the German soldiers
fired on us. I saw the corpses of some
women in the street. I fell down, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
woman who had been shot fell on top of me.’
Women and children suddenly turned out into
the streets, and, compelled to witness the destruction
of their homes by fire, provided a sad
spectacle to such as were sober enough to see.</p>

<p>“A humane German officer, witnessing the
ruin of Aerschot, exclaimed in disgust: ‘I am
a father myself, and I cannot bear this. It is
not war but butchery.’ Officers as well as men
succumbed to the temptation of drink, with results
which may be illustrated by an incident
which occurred at Campenhout. In this village
there was a certain well-to-do merchant
(name given) who had a cellar of good champagne.
On the afternoon of the 14th or 15th
of August three German cavalry officers entered
the house and demanded champagne.
Having drunk ten bottles and invited five or
six officers and three or four private soldiers
to join them, they continued their carouse, and
then called for the master and mistress of the
house.</p>

<p>“‘Immediately my mistress came in,’ says
the valet de chambre, ‘one of the officers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
was sitting on the floor got up, and, putting a
revolver to my mistress’ temple, shot her dead.
The officer was obviously drunk. The other
officers continued to drink and sing, and they
did not pay any great attention to the killing of
my mistress. The officer who shot my mistress
then told my master to dig a grave and bury my
mistress. My master and the officer went into
the garden, the officer threatening my master
with a pistol. My master was then forced to
dig the grave and to bury my mistress in it. I
cannot say for what reason they killed my mistress.
The officer who did it was singing all
the time.’</p>

<p>“In the evidence before us there are cases
tending to show that aggravated crimes against
women were sometimes severely punished.
One witness reports that a young girl who was
being pursued by a drunken soldier at Louvain
appealed to a German officer, and that the offender
was then and there shot. Another describes
how an officer of the Thirty-second
Regiment of the Line was led out to execution
for the violation of two young girls, but reprieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
at the request or with the consent of
the girls’ mother. These instances are sufficient
to show that the maltreatment of women
was no part of the military scheme of the invaders,
however much it may appear to have
been the inevitable result of the system of terror
deliberately adopted in certain regions.
Indeed, so much is avowed. ‘I asked the commander
why we had been spared,’ says a lady
in Louvain, who deposes to having suffered
much brutal treatment during the sack. He
said: ‘We will not hurt you any more. Stay
in Louvain. All is finished.’ It was Saturday,
August 29th, and the reign of terror was
over.</p>

<p>“The Germans used men, women and children
of Belgium as screens for advancing infantry,
as is shown in the following: Outside
Fort Fleron, near Liége, men and children
were marched in front of the Germans to prevent
the Belgian soldiers from firing. The
progress of the Germans through Mons was
marked by many incidents of this character.
Thus, on August 22d, half a dozen Belgian colliers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
returning from work were marching in
front of some German troops who were pursuing
the English, and in the opinion of the witnesses,
they must have been placed there intentionally.
An English officer describes how
he caused a barricade to be erected in a main
thoroughfare leading out of Mons, when the
Germans, in order to reach a crossroad in the
rear, fetched civilians out of the houses on each
side of the main road and compelled them to
hold up white flags and act as cover.</p>

<p>“Another British officer who saw this incident
is convinced that the Germans were acting
deliberately for the purpose of protecting
themselves from the fire of the British troops.
Apart from this protection, the Germans could
not have advanced, as the street was straight
and commanded by the British rifle fire at a
range of 700 or 800 yards. Several British
soldiers also speak of this incident, and their
story is confirmed by a Flemish witness in a
side street.”</p>

<p>The French Government also appointed a
commission, headed by M. Georges Payelle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
This body made an investigation of outrages
committed by German officers and soldiers in
Northern France. Its report showed conditions
that outstripped in horror the war tactics
of savages. It makes the following accusations:</p>

<p>“In Rebais, two English cavalrymen who
were surprised and wounded in this commune
were finished off with gunshots by the Germans
when they were dismounted and when
one of them had thrown up his hands, showing
thus that he was unarmed.</p>

<p>“In the department of the Marne, as everywhere
else, the German troops gave themselves
up to general pillage, which was carried out
always under similar conditions and with the
complicity of their leaders. The Communes
of Heiltz-le-Maurupt, Suippes, Marfaux,
Fromentieres and Esternay suffered especially
in this way. Everything which the invader
could carry off from the houses was placed on
motor lorries and vehicles. At Suippes, in
particular, they carried off in this way a quantity
of different objects, among these sewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
machines and toys. A great many villages, as
well as important country towns, were burned
without any reason whatever. Without doubt,
these crimes were committed by order, as German
detachments arrived in the neighborhood
with their torches, their grenades, and their
usual outfit for arson.</p>

<p>“At Marfaux nineteen private houses were
burned. Of the Commune of Glannes practically
nothing remains. At Somme-Tourbe
the entire village has been destroyed, with the
exception of the Mairie, the church and two
private buildings. At Auve nearly the whole
town has been destroyed. At Etrepy sixty-three
families out of seventy are homeless. At
Huiron all of the houses, with the exception of
five had been burned. At Sermaize-les-Bains
only about forty houses out of 900 remain.
At Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty houses out of
thirty-three are in ruins.</p>

<p>“At Suippes, the big market town which has
been practically burned out, German soldiers
carrying straw and cans of petrol have been
seen in the streets. While the mayor’s house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
was burning, six sentinels with fixed bayonets
were under orders to forbid any one to approach
and to prevent any help being given.</p>

<p>“All this destruction by arson, which only
represents a small proportion of the acts of the
same kind in the Department of Seine-et-Marne,
was accomplished without the least
tendency to rebellion or the smallest act of resistance
being recorded against the inhabitants
of the localities which are today more or less
completely destroyed. In some villages the
Germans, before setting fire to them, made one
of their soldiers fire a shot from his rifle so as to
be able to pretend afterward that the civilian
population had attacked them, an allegation
which is all the more absurd since at the time
when the enemy arrived, the only inhabitants
left were old men, sick persons, or people absolutely
without any means of aggression.</p>

<p>“Numerous crimes against the person have
also been committed. In the majority of the
communes hostages have been taken away;
many of them have not returned. At Sermaize-les-Bains,
the Germans carried off about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
one hundred and fifty people, some of whom
were decked out with helmets and coats and
compelled, thus equipped, to mount guard over
the bridges.</p>

<p>“At Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty men and
forty-five women and children were obliged to
leave with a detachment. One of the men—a
certain Emile Pierre—has not returned nor
sent any news of himself. At Corfelix, M.
Jacqet, who was carried off on the 7th of September
with eleven of his fellow-citizens, was
found five hundred meters from the village
with a bullet in his head.</p>

<p>“At Champuis, the curé, his maid-servant,
and four other inhabitants who were taken
away on the same day as the hostages of Corfelix
had not returned at the time of our visit
to the place.</p>

<p>“At the same place an old man of seventy,
named Jacquemin, was tied down in his bed
by an officer and left in this state without food
for three days. He died a little time after.
At Vert-la-Gravelle a farm hand was killed.
He was struck on the head with a bottle and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
chest was run through with a lance. The
garde champetre Brulefer of le Gault-la-Foret
was murdered at Maclaunay, where he had
been taken by the Germans. His body was
found with his head shattered and a wound on
his chest.</p>

<p>“At Champguyon, a commune which has
been fired, a certain Verdier was killed in his
father-in-law’s house. The latter was not
present at the execution, but he heard a shot
and next day an officer said to him, ‘Son shot.
He is under the ruins.’ In spite of the search
made the body has not been found among them.
It must have been consumed in the fire.</p>

<p>“At Sermaize, the roadmaker, Brocard, was
placed among a number of hostages. Just at
the moment when he was being arrested with
his son, his wife and his daughter-in-law in a
state of panic rushed to throw themselves into
the Saulx. The old man was able to free himself
for a moment and ran in all haste after
them and made several attempts to save them,
but the Germans dragged him away pitilessly,
leaving the two wretched women struggling in
the river. When Brocard and his son were
restored to liberty, four days afterward, and
found the bodies, they discovered that their
wives had both received bullet wounds in the
head.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“At Triaucourt the Germans gave themselves
up to the worst excesses. Angered
doubtless by the remark which an officer had
addressed to a soldier, against whom a young
girl of nineteen, Mlle. Helene Proces, had
made complaint on account of the indecent
treatment to which she had been subjected,
they burned the village and made a systematic
massacre of the inhabitants. They began by
setting fire to the house of an inoffensive householder,
M. Jules Gand, and by shooting this
unfortunate man as he was leaving his house to
escape the flames. Then they dispersed among
the houses in the streets, firing off their rifles on
every side. A young man, seventeen years,
Georges Lecourtier, who tried to escape was
shot. M. Alfred Lallemand suffered the same
fate. He was pursued into the kitchen of his
fellow-citizen Tautelier, and murdered there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
while Tautelier received three bullets in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Fearing, not without reason, for their lives,
Mlle. Proces, her mother and her grandmother
of seventy-one and her old aunt of
eighty-one, tried to cross the trellis which separates
their garden from a neighboring property
with the help of a ladder. The young girl
alone was able to reach the other side and to
avoid death by hiding in the cabbages. As for
the other women, they were struck down by
rifle shots. The village curé collected the
brains of the aunt on the ground on which they
were strewn and had the bodies carried into
Proces’ house. During the following night,
the Germans played the piano near the
bodies.</p>

<p>“While the carnage raged, the fire rapidly
spread and devoured thirty-five houses. An
old man of seventy and a child of two months
perished in the flames. M. Igier, who was
trying to save his cattle, was pursued for 300
meters by soldiers, who fired at him ceaselessly.
By a miracle this man had the good fortune not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to be wounded, but five bullets went through
his clothing.”</p>

<p>This summary merely hints at the atrocities
that were perpetrated. And these are the
crimes that France and Belgium will remember
after indemnities have been paid, after
borders have been re-established and after generations
shall have passed. The horrors of blazing
villages, of violated womanhood, of mutilated
childhood, of stark and senseless butcheries,
will flash before the minds of French and
Belgian men and women when Germany’s
name shall be mentioned long after the declaration
of peace.</p>

<p><i>Schrecklichkeit</i> had its day. It took its
bloody toll of the fairest and bravest of two
gallant nations. It ravaged Poland as well
and wreaked its fiendish will on wounded soldiers
on the battlefields.</p>

<p>But <i>Schrecklichkeit</i> is dead. Belgium and
France have shown that murder and rape and
arson cannot destroy liberty nor check the indomitable
ambitions of the free peoples of
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>The lesson to Germany was taught at a terrible
cost to humanity, but it was taught in a
fashion that nations hereafter who shall dream
of emulating the Hun will know in advance
that frightfulness serves no end except to feed
the lust for destruction that exists only in the
most debased and brutish of men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<span class="smcap">The First Battle of the Marne</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FRANCE and civilization were saved by
Joffre and Foch at the first battle of the
Marne in August, 1914.</p>

<p>Autocracy was destroyed by Foch at the
second battle of the Marne, 1918.</p>

<p>This in a nutshell embraces the dramatic
opening and closing episodes of the World
War on the soil of France. Bracketed between
these two glorious victories were the
agonies of martyred France, the deaths and
life-long cripplings of millions of men, the
up-rooting of arrogant militarism, the liberation
of captive nations.</p>

<p>The first battle of the Marne was wholly a
French operation. The British were close at
hand, but had no share in the victory. Generals
Gallieni and Manoury, acting under instructions
from Marshal Joffre, were driven by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
automobile to the headquarters of the British
commander, Sir John French, in the village of
Melun. They explained in detail General Joffre’s
plan of attack upon the advancing German
army. An urgent request was made
that the British army halt its retreat, face
about, and attack the two corps of von Kluck’s
army then confronting the British. Simultaneously
with this attack General Manoury’s
forces were to fall upon the flank and the rear
guard of von Kluck along the River Ourcq.
This operation was planned for the next day,
September 5th. Sir John French replied that
he could not get his tired army in readiness for
battle within forty-eight hours. This would
delay the British attack in all probability until
September 7th.</p>

<p>Joffre’s plan of battle, however, would admit
of no delay. The case was urgent; there
was grave danger of a union between the great
forces headed by the Crown Prince and those
under von Kluck. He resolved to go ahead
without the British, and ordered Manoury to
strike as had been planned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>He fixed as an extreme limit for the movement
of retreat, which was still going on, the
line of Bray-sur-Seine, Nogent-sur-Seine,
Arcis-sur-Aube, Vitry-le-François, and the region
to the north of Bar-le-Duc. This line
might be reached if the troops were compelled
to go back so far. They would attack before
reaching it, as soon as there was a possibility
of bringing about an offensive disposition, permitting
the co-operation of the whole of the
French forces.</p>

<p>On September 5 it appeared that this desired
situation existed.</p>

<p>The First German army, carrying audacity
to temerity, had continued its endeavor to envelop
the French left, had crossed the Grand
Morin, and reached the region of Chauffry,
to the south of Rebais and of Esternay. It
aimed then at cutting Joffre off from Paris, in
order to begin the investment of the capital.</p>

<p>The Second army had its head on the line
Champaubert, Etoges, Bergères, and Vertus.</p>

<p>The Third and Fourth armies reached to
Châlons-sur-Marne and Bussy-le-Répos. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Fifth army was advancing on one side and the
other from the Argonne as far as Triaucourt-les-Islettes
and Juivecourt. The Sixth and
Seventh armies were attacking more to the
east.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The First German Dash for Paris</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The French left army had been able to occupy
the line Sezanne, Villers-St. Georges and
Courchamps. This was precisely the disposition
which the General-in-Chief had wished to
see achieved. On the 4th he decided to take
advantage of it, and ordered all the armies to
hold themselves ready. He had taken from
his right two new army corps, two divisions of
infantry, and two divisions of cavalry, which
were distributed between his left and his center.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>On the evening of the 5th he addressed to
all the commanders of armies a message ordering
them to attack.</p>

<p>“The hour has come,” he wrote, “to advance
at all costs, and to die where you stand rather
than give way.”</p>

<p>If one examines the map, it will be seen that
by his inflection toward Meaux and Coulommiers
General von Kluck was exposing his
right to the offensive action of the French
left. This is the starting point of the victory
of the Marne.</p>

<p>On the evening of September 5th the French
left army had reached the front Penchard-Saint-Souflet-Ver.
On the 6th and 7th it continued
its attacks vigorously with the Ourcq
as objective. On the evening of the 7th it
was some kilometers from the Ourcq, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the front Chambry-Marcilly-Lisieux-Acy-en-Multien.
On the 8th, the Germans, who had
in great haste reinforced their right by bringing
their Second and Fourth army corps back
to the north, obtained some successes by attacks
of extreme violence. But in spite of this
pressure the French held their ground. In a
brilliant action they took three standards, and
being reinforced prepared a new attack for the
10th. At the moment that this attack was
about to begin the enemy was already in retreat
toward the north. The attack became a
pursuit, and on the 12th the French established
themselves on the Aisne.</p>

<p>Why did the German forces which were confronting
the French, and on the evening before
attacking so furiously, retreat on the morning
of the 10th? Because in bringing back on the
6th several army corps from the south to the
north to face the French left, the enemy had
exposed his left to the attacks of the now
rested British, who had immediately faced
around toward the north, and to those of the
French armies which were prolonging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
English lines to the right. This is what the
French command had sought to bring about.
This is what happened on September 8th and
allowed the development and rehabilitation
which it was to effect.</p>

<p>On the 6th the British army set out from the
line Rozcy-Langny and that evening reached
the southward bank of the Grand Morin. On
the 7th and 8th it continued its march, and on
the 9th had debouched to the north of the
Marne below Château-Thierry—the town that
was to become famous for the American stand
in 1918—taking in flank the German forces
which on that day were opposing, on the Ourcq,
the French left army. Then it was that these
forces began to retreat, while the British army,
going in pursuit and capturing seven guns
and many prisoners, reached the Aisne between
Soissons and Longueval.</p>

<p>The rôle of the French army, which was operating
to the right of the British army, was
threefold. It had to support the British attacking
on its left. It had on its right to support
the center, which, from September 7th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
had been subjected to a German attack of
great violence. Finally, its mission was to
throw back the three active army corps and the
reserve corps which faced it.</p>

<p>On the 7th, it made a leap forward, and on
the following days reached and crossed the
Marne, seizing, after desperate fighting, guns,
howitzers, mitrailleuses, and a million cartridges.
On the 12th it established itself on
the north edge of the Montagne-de-Reime in
contact with the French center, which for its
part had just forced the enemy to retreat in
haste.</p>

<p>The French center consisted of a new army
created on August 29th and of one of those
which at the beginning of the campaign had
been engaged in Belgian Luxemburg. The
first had retreated, on August 29th to September
5th, from the Aisne to the north of the
Marne and occupied the general front Sezanne-Mailly.</p>

<p>The second, more to the east, had drawn
back to the south of the line Humbauville-Château-Beauchamp-Bignicourt-Blesmes-Maurupt-le-Montoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>The enemy, in view of his right being arrested
and the defeat of his enveloping movement,
made a desperate effort from the 7th to
the 19th to pierce the French center to the
west and to the east of Fere-Champenoise.
On the 8th he succeeded in forcing back the
right of the new French army, which retired
as far as Gouragançon. On the 9th, at 6
o’clock in the morning, there was a further retreat
to the south of that village, while on the
left the other army corps also had to go back
to the line Allemant-Connantre.</p>

<p>Despite this retreat General Foch, commanding
the army of the center, ordered a general
offensive for the same day. With the Morocco
division, whose behavior was heroic, he
met a furious assault of the Germans on his
left toward the marshes of Saint Gond. Then
with the divisions which had just victoriously
overcome the attacks of the enemy to the north
of Sezanne, and with the whole of his left army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
corps, he made a flanking attack in the evening
of the 9th upon the German forces, and notably
the guard, which had thrown back his right
army corps. The enemy, taken by surprise
by this bold maneuver, did not resist, and beat
a hasty retreat. This marked Foch as the
most daring and brilliant strategist of the
war.</p>

<p>On the 11th the French crossed the Marne
between Tours-sur-Marne and Sarry, driving
the Germans in front of them in disorder. On
the 12th they were in contact with the enemy
to the north of the Champ de Châlons. The
reserve army of the center, acting on the right
of the one just referred to, had been intrusted
with the mission during the 7th, 8th, and 9th
of disengaging its neighbor, and it was only
on the 10th that being reinforced by an army
corps from the east, it was able to make its
action effectively felt. On the 11th the Germans
retired. But, perceiving their danger,
they fought desperately, with enormous expenditure
of projectiles, behind strong intrenchments.
On the 12th the result had none
the less been attained, and two French center
armies were solidly established on the ground
gained.</p>

<p>The crushing defeat of the armies of the Central Powers is due in large measure
to the remarkable strategy and superb leadership of this great French soldier.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>To the right of these two armies were three
others. They had orders to cover themselves
to the north and to debouch toward the west
on the flank of the enemy, which was operating
to the west of the Argonne. But a wide
interval in which the Germans were in force
separated them from the French center. The
attack took place, nevertheless, with very brilliant
success for the French artillery, which
destroyed eleven batteries of the Sixteenth
German army corps.</p>

<p>On the 10th inst., the Eighth and Fifteenth
German army corps counter-attacked, but were
repulsed. On the 11th French progress continued
with new successes, and on the 12th the
French were able to face round toward the
north in expectation of the near and inevitable
retreat of the enemy, which, in fact, took place
from the 13th.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the mass of the German
force involved also that of the left. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
12th onward the forces of the enemy operating
between Nancy and the Vosges retreated in a
hurry before the two French armies of the
East, which immediately occupied the positions
that the enemy had evacuated. The offensive
of the French right had thus prepared and consolidated
in the most useful way the result secured
by the left and center.</p>

<p>Such was this seven days’ battle, in which
more than two millions of men were engaged.
Each army gained ground step by step, opening
the road to its neighbor, supported at once
by it, taking in flank the adversary which the
day before it had attacked in front, the efforts
of one articulating closely with those of the
other, a perfect unity of intention and method
animating the supreme command.</p>

<p>To give this victory all its meaning it is necessary
to add that it was gained by troops which
for two weeks had been retreating, and which,
when the order for the offensive was given,
were found to be as ardent as on the first day.
It has also to be said that these troops had to
meet the whole German army. Under their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
pressure the German retreat at certain times
had the appearance of a rout.</p>

<p>In spite of the fatigue of the poilus, in spite
of the power of the German heavy artillery,
the French took colors, guns, mitrailleuses,
shells, and thousands of prisoners. One German
corps lost almost the whole of its artillery.</p>

<p>In that great battle the spectacular rush of
General Gallieni’s army defending Paris, was
one of the dramatic surprises that decided the
issue. In that stroke Gallieni sent his entire
force forty miles to attack the right wing of
the German army. In this gigantic maneuver
every motor car in Paris was utilized, and the
flying force of Gallieni became the “Army in
Taxicabs,” a name that will live as long as
France exists.</p>

<p>General Clergerie, Chief of Staff of Gallieni,
told the story for posterity. He said:</p>

<p>“From August 26, 1914, the German armies
had been descending upon Paris by forced
marches. On September 1st they were only
three days’ march from the advanced line of
the intrenched camp, which the garrison were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
laboring desperately to put into condition for
defense. It was necessary to cover with
trenches a circuit of 110 miles, install siege
guns, assure the coming of supplies for them
over narrow-gauge railways, assemble the food
and provisions of all kinds necessary for a city
of 4,000,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>“But on September 3rd, the intelligence
service, which was working perfectly, stated
about the middle of the day, that the German
columns, after heading straight for Paris, were
swerving toward the southeast and seemed to
wish to avoid the fortified camp.</p>

<p>“General Gallieni and I then had one of
those long conferences which denoted grave
events; they usually lasted from two to five
minutes at most. The fact is that the military
government of Paris did little talking—it
acted. The conference reached this conclusion:
‘If they do not come to us, we will go to
them with all the force we can muster.’ Nothing
remained but to make the necessary preparations.
The first thing to do was not to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the alarm to the enemy. General Manoury’s
army immediately received orders to lie low
and avoid any engagement that was not absolutely
necessary.” Then care was taken to reinforce
it by every means. All was ready at
the designated time.</p>

<p>In the night of September 3rd, knowing that
the enemy would have to leave only a rear
guard on one bank of the Ourcq, General Gallieni
and General Clergerie decided to march
against that rear guard, to drive it back with
all the weight of the Manoury army, to cut
the enemy’s communications, and take full advantage
of his hazardous situation. Immediately
the following order was addressed to
General Manoury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because of the movement of the German armies, which
seem to be slipping in before our front to the southeast,
I intend to send your army to attack them in the flank,
that is to say, in an easterly direction. I will indicate
your line of march as soon as I learn that of the British
army. But make your arrangements now so that your
troops shall be ready to march this afternoon and to
begin a general movement east of the intrenched camp
tomorrow.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>At ten in the morning a consultation was
held by Generals Gallieni, Clergerie, and
Manoury, and the details of the plan of operations
were immediately decided. General
Joffre gave permission to attack and announced
that he would himself take the offensive
on the 6th. On the 5th, at noon, the army
from Paris fired the first shot; the battle of
the Ourcq, a preface to the Marne, had begun.</p>

<p>General Clergerie then told what a precious
purveyor of information he had found in General
von der Marwitz, cavalry commander of
the German first army, who made intemperate
use of the wireless telegraph and did not even
take the trouble to put into cipher his dispatches,
of which the Eiffel Tower made a careful
collection. “In the evening of September
9th,” he said, “an officer of the intelligence
corps brought me a dispatch from this same
Marwitz couched in something like these
terms: ‘Tell me exactly where you are and
what you are doing. Hurry up, because
XXX.’ The officer was greatly embarrassed
to interpret those three X’s. Adopting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
language of the poilu, I said to him, ‘Translate
it, “I am going to bolt.”’ True enough, next
day we found on the site of the German batteries,
which had been precipitately evacuated,
stacks of munitions; while by the roadside we
came upon motors abandoned for the slightest
breakdown, and near Betz almost the entire
outfit of a field bakery, with a great store of
flour and dough half-kneaded. Paris and
France were saved.</p>

<p>“Von Kluck could not get over his astonishment.
He has tried to explain it by saying he
was unlucky, for out of a hundred Governors
not one would have acted as Gallieni did,
throwing his whole available force nearly forty
miles from his stronghold. It was downright
imprudence.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<span class="smcap">Japan in the War</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON August 15, 1914, the Empire of Japan
issued an ultimatum to Germany.
She demanded the evacuation of Tsing-tau,
the disarming of the warships there and the
handing over of the territory to Japan for ultimate
reversion to China. The time limit for
her reply was set at 12 o’clock, August 24th.
To this ultimatum Germany made no reply,
and at 2:30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, August 23d, the German
Ambassador was handed his passports and war
was declared.</p>

<p>The reason for the action of Japan was simple.
She was bound by treaty to Great
Britain to come to her aid in any war in which
Great Britain might be involved. On August
4th a note was received from Great Britain requesting
Japan to safeguard British shipping
in the Far East. Japan replied that she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
not guarantee the safety of British shipping so
long as Germany was in occupation of the Chinese
province of Tsing-tau. She suggested in
turn that England agree to allow her to remove
this German menace. The British Government
agreed, on the condition that Tsing-tau
be subsequently returned to China.</p>

<p>The Japanese Government in taking this
stand was acting with courage and with loyalty.
Toward individual Germans she entertained
no animosity. She had the highest respect for
German scholarship and German military science.
She had been sending her young men to
German seats of learning, and had based the
reorganization of her army upon the German
military system. But she did not believe that
a treaty was a mere “scrap of paper,” and was
determined to fulfil her obligations in the treaty
with England.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the opinion of the
highest Japanese military authorities that Germany
would win the war. Japan’s statesmen,
however, believed that Germany was a menace
to both China and Japan and had lively recollections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
of her unfriendly attitude in connection
with the Chino-Japanese war and in the
period that followed. Germany had been
playing the same game in China that she had
played in the Mediterranean and which had ultimately
brought about the war.</p>

<p>The Chino-Japanese war had been a great
Japanese triumph. One of Japan’s greatest
victories had been the capture of Port Arthur,
but the joy caused in Japan had not ended
before it was into mourning because of German
interference. Germany had then compelled
Japan to quit Port Arthur, and to hand
over that great fort to Russia so that she herself
might take Kiao-chau without Russia’s objection.</p>

<p>Japan had never forgotten or forgiven.
The German seizure of Kiao-chau had led to
the Russian occupation of Port Arthur, the
British occupation of Wei-hai-wei and French
occupation of Kwan-chow Bay. The vultures
were swooping down on defenseless China.
This had led to the Boxer disturbance of 1910,
where again the Kaiser had interfered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Japan, who recognized that her interests and
safety were closely allied with the preservation
of the territorial integrity of China, had proposed
to the powers that she be permitted to
send her troops to the rescue of the beleaguered
foreigners, but this proposition was refused on
account of German suspicion of Japan’s motives.
Later on, during the Russo-Japanese
war, Russia was assisted in many ways by the
German Government.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the popular sympathy with
the Japanese was strongly with the Allies. It
was the Kaiser who started the cry of the “yellow
peril,” which had deeply hurt Japanese
pride. Yet, even with this strong feeling, it
was remarkable that Japan was willing to ally
herself with Russia. She knew very well that
after all the greatest danger to her liberties lay
across the Japan Sea. Russian autocracy,
with its militarism, its religious intolerance, its
discriminating policy against foreign interests
in commerce and trade, was the natural opponent
of liberal Japan.</p>

<p>The immediate object of Japan in joining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
hands with England was to destroy the German
menace in the Pacific. Before she delivered
her ultimatum the Germans had been active;
ignoring the rights of Japan while she
was still neutral they had captured a Russian
steamer within Japanese jurisdiction, as well
as a number of British merchant vessels, and
even a few Japanese ships had been intercepted
by German cruisers. This was the disturbance
to general peace in the Far East, which
had prompted England to request Japan’s assistance.</p>

<p>Japan, when she entered the war, was at
least twice as strong as when she began the
war with Russia. She had an army of one million
men, and a navy double the size of that
which she had possessed when the Treaty of
Portsmouth was signed. As soon as war was
declared she proceeded to act. A portion of
her fleet was directed against the German
forces in the Pacific, one squadron occupying
Jaluit, the seat of government of the Marshall
Islands, on October 3d, but her main forces
were directed against the fortress of Tsing-tau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>The Germans had taken great pride in
Tsing-tau, and had made every effort to make
it a model colony as well as an impregnable
fortress. They had built costly water works,
fine streets and fine public buildings. They
had been making great preparations for a state
of siege, although it was not expected that they
would be able to hold out for a long time.
There were hardly more than five thousand
soldiers in the fortress, and in the harbor but
four small gunboats and an Austrian cruiser,
the Kaiserin Elizabeth. As Austria was not
at war with Japan the authorization of Japan
was asked for the removal of the Kaiserin
Elizabeth to Shanghai, where she could be interned.
The Japanese were favorable to this
proposition, but at the last moment instructions
arrived from Vienna directing the Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador to ask for his passports
at Tokio and the commander of the Kaiserin
Elizabeth to assist the Germans in the
defense of Tsing-tau. The Germans also received
orders to defend their fortress to the
very last. A portion of the German squadron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
under Admiral von Spee, had sailed away
before the Japanese attack, one of these being
the famous commerce raider, the Emden.</p>

<p>On the 27th of August the Japanese made
their first move by taking possession of some
of the small islands at the mouth of the harbor
of Kiao-chau. From these points as bases
they swept the surrounding waters for mines,
with such success that during the whole siege
but one vessel of their fleet was injured by a
mine. On the 2d of September they landed
troops at the northern base of the peninsula
upon which Tsing-tau was situated, with the
object of cutting off the fortress from the mainland.</p>

<p>The heavy rains which were customary at
that season prevented much action, but airplanes
were sent which dropped bombs upon
the wireless station, electric power station and
railway station of Kiao-chau, and upon the
ships in the harbor. On September 13th General
Kamio captured the railway station of
Kiao-chau which stands at the head of the bay.
This placed him twenty-two miles from Tsing-tau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> 
itself. On September 27th he captured
Prince Heinrich Hill, giving him a gun position
from which he could attack the inner forts.
On the 23d a small British force arrived from
Wei-hai-wei to co-operate with the Japanese.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_177">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_177.jpg" alt="The German Gibraltar in the Far East">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The German Gibraltar in the Far East Which Fell to the
Japanese</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The combined forces then advanced until
they were only five miles from Tsing-tau.
The German warships were bombarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Japanese troops fiercely, and were being replied
to by the Japanese squadron in the mouth
of the harbor. The great waste of German
ammunition led General Kamio to the opinion
that the Germans did not contemplate a long
siege. He then determined on a vigorous assault.</p>

<p>Before the attack was made he gave the non-combatants
an opportunity of leaving, and on
the 15th of October a number of women and
children and Chinese were allowed to pass
through the Japanese lines. On October 31st
the bombardment began, and the German
forts were gradually silenced. On November
2d the Kaiserin Elizabeth was sunk in the harbor.</p>

<p>The Allied armies were pushing their way
steadily down, until, on November 6th, their
trenches were along the edge of the last German
redoubts. At 6 o’clock on that day white
flags were floating over the central forts and
by 7.30 Admiral Waldeck, the German Governor,
had signed the terms of capitulation.</p>

<p>Germany’s prize colony on the continent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Asia had disappeared. The survivors, numbering
about three thousand, were sent to Japan
as prisoners of war. Japanese losses were
but two hundred and thirty-six men killed.
They had, however, lost one third-class cruiser,
the Takachiho, and several smaller crafts.
The whole expedition was a notable success.
It had occupied much less time than either Japan
or Germany had expected, and the news
was received in Germany with a universal feeling
of bitterness and chagrin.</p>

<p>After the Japanese capture of Kiao-chau
Japan’s assistance to the Allies, while not spectacular,
was extremely important, and its importance
increased during the last two years
of the war. Her cruiser squadrons did continuous
patrol duty in the Pacific and in the
China Sea and even in the Indian Ocean. She
occupied three groups of German Islands in
the South Sea, assisted in driving German
raiders from the Pacific, and by her efficiency
permitted a withdrawal of British warships to
points where they could be useful nearer home.
She patrolled the Pacific coast of North and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
South America, landed marines to quell riots
at Singapore, and finally entered into active
service in European waters by sending a destroyer
squadron to the assistance of the Allies
in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Japanese fleet was one of the strongest
in the world. It had twenty-one first- and second-class
cruisers, ten superb new destroyers,
with a reserve of twenty others, as well as
twenty battle-ships and battle cruisers.</p>

<p>One of Japan’s most important contributions
to the cause of the Allies was her assistance
in convoying to Europe the Anzac troops,
and it was because of the approach of her fleet
that the German raiding squadron in the South
Pacific was driven to the point near the Falkland
Islands where it was destroyed by Admiral
Cradock’s British cruisers.</p>

<p>But while the aid of Japan’s navy was important
to the Allies, her greatest assistance
to the Allied cause was what she did in supplying
Russia with military supplies. The
tremendous struggle carried on by Russia’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
forces during the first years prevented an easy
German victory, and was only made possible
through the assistance of Japan. Enormous
quantities of guns, ammunition, military stores,
hospital and Red Cross supplies, were sent into
Russia, with skilled officers and experts to accompany
them. Before the Russian revolution
disorganized Russia the total value of
those supplies had reached $250,000,000. This
tremendous exportation, of course, enormously
benefited Japan, but it was essential to Russia.
Japan also shipped to both England and
France vast quantities of flour, beans, peas and
canned goods, and other supplies in proportion.
Japan’s financial aid was also of great
value. She made great loans, to Russia $60,000,000;
to Great Britain $50,000,000. She
has become today a great workshop, and her
merchant shipping has grown in proportion to
the growth of her manufactures. Immense
cargoes were moved, not only from Japan to
Allied countries, but from the American seaboard
to Vladivostok. More than one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
thousand Chinese laborers were put at the
service of the Allies in France and England,
and a great part of her magnificent merchant
fleet was sent as a reinforcement to the merchant
fleets of the Atlantic powers when they
had been depleted by the attacks of the German
submarines.</p>

<p>In the last year of the war Japan once more
came prominently in the public eye in connection
with the effort made by the Allies to protect
from the Russian Bolsheviki vast stores of
ammunition which had been landed in ports of
Eastern Siberia. She was compelled to land
troops to do this and to preserve order in localities
where her citizens were in danger. Upon
the development of the Czecho-Slovak movement
in Eastern Siberia a Japanese force, in
association with troops from the United States
and Great Britain, was landed to protect the
Czecho-Slovaks from Bolsheviki treachery.
These troops succeeded in their object, and
throughout the latter period of the war kept
Eastern Siberia friendly to the Allied cause.
In this campaign there was but little blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
shed. The expedition was followed by the
strong sympathy of the allied world which was
full of admiration for the loyalty and courage
of the Czecho-Slovaks and their heroic leaders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<span class="smcap">Campaign in the East</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LONG before the declaration of war the
German military experts had made their
plans. They recognized that in case of war
with Russia, France would come to the rescue
of its ally. They hoped that Italy, and felt
sure that England, would remain neutral, but,
no doubt, had provided for the possibility that
these two nations would join the ranks of their
foes. They recognized that they would be
compelled to fight against greatly superior
numbers, but they had this advantage, that
they were prepared to move at once, while
England was unprepared, and Russia, with
enormous numbers, was so unprovided with
railroad facilities that it would take weeks before
her armies would be dangerous.</p>

<p>Their plan of campaign, then, was obvious.
Leaving in the East only such forces as were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
necessary for a strong defense, they would
throw the bulk of their strength against the
French. They anticipated an easy march to
Paris, and then with France at their mercy
they would gather together all their powers and
deal with Russia. But they had underestimated
both the French power of resistance,
and the Russian weakness, and in particular
they had not counted upon the check that they
were to meet with in gallant Belgium.</p>

<p>The Russian mobilization was quicker by far
than had been anticipated. Her armies were
soon engaged with the comparatively small
German forces, and met with great success.</p>

<p>To understand the Russian campaign one
must have some knowledge of the geography
of western Russia. Russian Poland projects
as a great quadrilateral into eastern Germany.
It is bounded on the north by East Prussia,
on the south by Galicia, and the western part
reaches deep into Germany itself. The land
is a broad, level plain, through which from
south to north runs the River Vistula. In the
center lies the capital, Warsaw, protected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
a group of fortresses. The Russian army,
therefore, could not make a direct western
advance until it had protected its flanks by the
conquest of East Prussia on the north, and
Galicia on the south.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the third week in August
the first Russian armies were ready. Her
forces were arranged as follows: Facing East
Prussia was the Army of the Niemen, four
corps strong; the Army of Poland, consisting
of fifteen army corps, occupied a wide front
from Narev on the north to the Bug Valley; a
third army, the Army of Galicia, directed its
line of advance southward into the country between
Lemberg and the River Sareth. The
fortresses protecting Warsaw, still further to
the east, were well garrisoned, and in front of
them to the west were troops intended to delay
any German advance from Posen. The Russian
commander-in-chief was the Grand Duke
Nicholas, uncle of the late Czar, and one of
the most admirable representatives of the Russian
at his best; a splendid soldier, honest,
straightforward, and patriotic, he was the idol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of his men. He had with him a brilliant staff,
but the strength of his army lay in its experience.
They had learned war in the bitter
school of the Manchurian campaign.</p>

<p>The German force on the frontier was not
less than five hundred thousand men, and they
were arranged for defense. Austria, in Galicia,
had gathered nearly one million men under
the auspices of Frederick. The first movement
of these armies took place in East Prussia.
The Army of the Niemen had completed
its mobilization early in August, and was under
the command of General Rennenkampf, one of
the Russian leaders in Manchuria. In command
of the German forces was General von
François, an officer of Huguenot descent.</p>

<p>The first clash of these armies took place on
the German frontier near Libau, on August
3d. Two days later, the Russians crossed the
frontier, drove in the German advance posts,
and seized the railway which runs south and
east of the Masurian Lakes. The German
force fell back, burning villages and destroying
roads, according to their usual plan. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the 7th of August the main army of Rennenkampf
crossed the border at Suwalki, advancing
in two main bodies: the Army of the Niemen
moving north from Suwalki, the Army of
the Narev marching through the region of the
Masurian lakes. In the lake district they advanced
toward Boyen, and then directed their
march toward Insterburg, the most important
town in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>To protect Insterburg, General von François
made his first stand at Gumbinnen, where,
on the 16th of August, the first important battle
of this campaign took place. The result
was the defeat and retirement of the Germans,
and von François was forced to fall back on
Koenigsberg.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Army of the Narev, under
General Samsonov, was advancing through the
country west of the Masurian Lakes. On the
20th his vanguard came upon a German army
corps, strongly entrenched at the northwest end
of the lakes. The Germans were defeated, and
fled in great disorder toward Koenigsberg,
abandoning their guns and wagons. Many
prisoners were taken, and the Russians found
themselves masters of all of East Prussia except
that inside the Koenigsberg line. They
then marched on Koenigsberg, and East Prussia
was for a moment at the mercy of the conqueror.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Troops were left to invest Koenigsberg, and
East Prussia was overrun with the enemy.
The report as to the behavior of these troops
met with great indignation in Germany; but
better information insists that they behaved
with decorum and discretion. The peasantry
of East Prussia, remembering wild tales of
the Cossacks of a hundred years before, fled in
confusion with stories of burning and slaughter
and outrage.</p>

<p>Germany became aroused. To thoroughly
understand the effect of the Russian invasion
of east Prussia, one must know something
of the relations of that district with the German
Empire. Historically, this was the cradle of
the Prussian aristocracy, whose dangerous policies
had alarmed Europe for so many decades.
The Prussian aristocracy originated in a mixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
of certain west German and Christian
knights, with a pagan population of the eastern
Baltic plain. The district was separate from
Poland and never fell under the Polish influence.
It was held by the Teutonic knights
who conquered it in a sort of savage independence.
The Christian faith, which the Teutonic
knights professed to inculcate, took little root,
but such civilization as Germany itself had
absorbed did filter in. The chief noble of
Borussia, the governing Duke, acquired in time
the title of King, and it was here, not in Berlin,
nor in Brandenburg, that the Hohenzollern
power originated.</p>

<p>East Prussia, therefore, had a sentimental
importance in the eyes of the Prussian nobility.
The Prussian Royal House, in particular, had
toward this country an especial regard.
Moreover, it was regarded by the Germans as
a whole as their rampart against the Slav, a
proof of the German power to withstand the
dreaded Russian. That this sacred soil should
now be in the hands of a Cossack army was not
to be borne. The Kaiser acted at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_191.jpg" alt="THE EASTERN FIGHTING ZONE">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE EASTERN FIGHTING ZONE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Large forces were detached from the west
and sent to the aid of the eastern army. A new
commander was appointed. He was General
von Hindenburg, a veteran of the Franco-Prussian
War who had been for some years
retired. After his retirement he devoted his
time to the study of East Prussia, especially
the ground around the Masurian Lakes. He
became more familiar with its roads, its fields,
its marshes, its bogs than any of the peasants
who spent their lives in the neighborhood of
the lakes. Before his retirement, in the annual
maneuvers, he had often rehearsed his
defense against Russian invaders. Indeed report,
perhaps unfounded, described his retirement
to the displeasure of the Emperor William
at being badly worsted in one of these
mimic combats. He had prevented the country
from being cleared and the swamps from
being drained, arguing that they were worth
more to Germany than a dozen fortresses. A
man of rugged strength, his face suggesting
power and tenacity, he was to become the idol
of the German people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>His chance had come. His army consisted
of remnants of the forces of von François and
large reinforcements sent him from the west.
In all, perhaps, he had with him 150,000 men,
and he had behind him an admirable system of
strategic railways.</p>

<p>The Russian High Command was full of
confidence. Rennenkampf had advanced with
the army of the Niemen toward Koenigsberg,
whose fall was reported from time to time,
without foundation. Koenigsberg was in fact
impregnable to armies no stronger than those
under Rennenkampf’s command. Samsonov
with the Army of the Narev, had pushed on to
the northeastern point of the lakes, and defeated
the German army corps at Frankenau.
Misled by his success, he decided to continue
his advance through the lake region toward
Allenstein. He marched first toward Osterode,
in the wilderness of forest, lake and marsh,
between Allenstein and the Lower Vistula.
His force numbered 200,000 men, but the
swamps made it impossible to proceed in mass.
His column had to be temporarily divided, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
was he well informed as to the strength of his
enemy. On Wednesday, the 26th of August,
his advance guards were everywhere driven in.
As he pushed on he discovered the enemy in
great numbers, and late in the day realized
that he was facing a great army.</p>

<p>Von Hindenburg had taken a position
astride the railway from Allenstein to Soldau,
and all access to his front was barred by lakes
and swamps. He was safe from frontal attack,
and could reinforce each wing at pleasure.
From his right ran the only two good
roads in the region, and at his left was the
Osterode railway. On the first day he stood
on the defensive, while the Russians, confident
of victory, attacked again and again. Some
ground was won and prisoners captured, and
the news of a second victory was sent to western Europe.</p>

<p>The battle continued, however, until the last
day of August and is known as the battle of
Tannenberg, from a village of that name near
the marshes. Having worn down his enemy,
von Hindenburg counter-attacked. His first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
movement was on his right. This not only
deceived Samsonov and led him to reinforce
his left, but also enabled von Hindenburg to
seize the only good road that would give the
Russian army a chance of retreat. Meanwhile
the German general was hurrying masses
of troops northeastward to outflank the Russian
right. While the Russians were reinforcing
one flank, he was concentrating every man
he could upon the other. Then his left swept
southward, driving in and enveloping the Russian
right, and Samsonov was driven into a
country full of swamps and almost without
roads.</p>

<p>To thoroughly understand the plight of the
Russian army one must have some idea of the
character of the Masurian Lake district. It
was probably molded by the work of ice in the
past. Great glaciers, in their progress toward
the sea, have ground out hundreds of hollows,
where are found small pools and considerable
lakes. From these glaciers have been dropped
patches of clay which hold the waters in wide
extents of marsh and bog. The country presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
a monotonous picture of low, rounded
swells and flats, interspersed with stunted pine
and birch woods. The marshes and the lakes
form a labyrinth, difficult to pass even to those
familiar with the country. The Masurian region
is a great trap for any commander who
has not had unlimited acquaintance with the
place. Causeways, filled with great care, and
railroads permit an orderly advance, but in a
confused retreat disaster at once threatens.</p>

<p>This was the ground that von Hindenburg
knew so well. The Russians resisted desperately,
but their position could not be held.
Disaster awaited them. They found their
guns sinking to the axle-trees in mire. Whole
regiments were driven into the lakes and
drowned. On the last day of battle, August
31st, Samsonov himself was killed, and his
army completely destroyed. Fifty thousand
prisoners were taken with hundreds of guns
and quantities of supplies. Von Hindenburg
had attained the triumph of which he had so
long dreamed.</p>

<p>It was an immensely successful example of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
that enveloping movement characteristic of
German warfare, a victory recalling the battle
of Sedan, and upon a scale not inferior to
that battle. The news of this great triumph
reached Berlin upon the anniversary of the battle
of Sedan, and on the same day that the
news came from the west that von Kluck had
reached the gates of Paris and it had a profound
effect upon the German mind. They
had grown to believe that the Germans were a
sort of superman; these wonderful successes
confirmed them in this belief.</p>

<p>No longer did they talk of a mere defense
in the east; an advance on Warsaw was demanded
and von Hindenburg was acclaimed
the greatest soldier of his day. The Emperor
made him Field Marshal, and placed him in
command of the Teutonic armies in the east.</p>

<p>But von Hindenburg was not satisfied. The
remnant of the defeated army had fled toward
Narev, and without losing a moment von Hindenburg
set off in pursuit. Rennenkampf, all
this time, strange to say, had made no move,
and at the news of Samsonov’s disaster he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
abandoned the siege of Koenigsberg and retreated
toward the Niemen. At Gumbinnen
he fought a rear-guard action with the German
left, but had made up his mind that the Niemen
must be the Russian line of defense. Von
Hindenburg, following, crossed the Russian
frontier and in the wide forests near Augustovo
there was much fighting.</p>

<p>This action, described as the first battle of
Augustovo, was only a rear-guard action, the
Russians desiring merely to delay the enemy
for a day or two. German reports, however,
described it as a victory only second in importance
to Tannenberg. Von Hindenburg
then occupied Suwalki. He apparently had
become over confident, and hardly realized that
Rennenkampf was continually being reinforced
by the Russian mobilization.</p>

<p>The Russian High Command understood
the situation very well. Their aim was to keep
von Hindenburg busy on the Niemen, while
their armies in the south were overwhelming
the fleeing Austrians. Von Hindenburg was
deceived, and continued his advance until he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
got into serious trouble. His movement had
begun on September 7th; his army consisted
of the four corps with which he had won
Tannenberg, and large reinforcements from
Germany, including at least one guards battalion,
and a number of Saxons and Bavarians.
The country is one vast mixture of marsh and
lake and bog. The roads are few, and advance
must therefore be slow and difficult. Rennenkampf
made no attempt to delay him beyond
a little rear-guard fighting. The German
army reached the Niemen on September
21st, and found behind it the Russian army in
prepared positions, with large reinforcements
from Vilna.</p>

<p>The river at this point was wide and deep,
and hard to cross. The battle of the Niemen
Crossings was an artillery duel. The Russians
quietly waited in their trenches to watch
the Germans build their pontoon bridges. Then
their guns blew the bridges to pieces. Thereupon
von Hindenburg bombarded the Russian
lines hoping to destroy the Russian guns. On
Friday, the 26th, his guns boomed all day; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Russians made no reply. So on the morning
of the 27th he built bridges again, and again
the Russians blew them to pieces. Moreover
the marshy ground made maneuvering almost
impossible. On the 28th he gave the order
for retreat.</p>

<p>He realized that the game wasn’t worth the
candle; he might easily be kept fighting on the
Niemen for months, while the main armies of
the Russians were crossing Austria. Von
Hindenburg conducted the retreat with a skill
which came to him naturally from his knowledge
of the marshes.</p>

<p>Rennenkampf followed him closely, keeping
up persistent attacks through the woods and
marshes. The path of the retreating army lay
through the forest of Augustovo, a country
much like that around the Masurian Lakes,
and there the Germans suffered heavy losses.
Von Hindenburg managed, however, to get
the bulk of his forces back across the frontier
and continued his retreat to the intrenchments
on the Masurian Lakes.</p>

<p>The Germans lost 60,000 men in killed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
wounded and prisoners, and von Hindenburg
handed over the command of the German
armies in East Prussia to General von Schubert,
and hastened southward to direct the
movement to relieve the Austrians at Cracow.</p>

<p>But quite as important as the campaign in
East Prussia was the struggle in Galicia.
When the war began the Germans contemplated
merely defense in their own domain;
such offense as was planned was left to the
Austrians farther south.</p>

<p>Galicia is a long, level country lying north of
the Carpathian Mountains, and in this country
Austria-Hungary had gathered together a
force of hardly less than one million men. A
quarter of these lay in reserve near the mountains;
the remaining three-quarters was divided
into two armies; the first, the northern
army, being under the command of General
Dankl, the second was that of von Offenberg.
The base of the first army was Przemysl; that
of the second was Lemberg.</p>

<p>The first army, it was planned, was to advance
into Russian territory in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
of Lublin. The second army, stationed southeast
of the first army, was to protect it from
any Russians who might strike in upon the
south. The first army, therefore, contained
more picked material than the second, which
included many troops from the southern parts
of the empire, including certain disaffected
contingents. The first army made its advance
as soon as possible, and entered Russian territory
on the 11th of August. It went forward
with very little loss and against very little
resistance. The Russian forces which were
against it were inferior in number, and fell
back towards the Bug. The Austrians followed,
turning somewhat toward the East,
when their advance was checked by news of
catastrophe in their rear. On the 14th of August
the Russian army under General Ruzsky
crossed the frontier, and advanced toward the
Austrian second army.</p>

<p>The Russian army was in far greater
strength than had been expected, and when its
advance was followed by the appearance, upon
the right flank of von Offenberg’s command, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
yet another Russian army, under Brussilov,
the Austrian second army found itself in great
danger. Ruzsky advanced steadily from August
14th until, on the 21st, it was not more
than one day’s advance from the outer works
of Lemberg, and the third Russian army under
Brussilov was threatening von Offenberg’s
right flank.</p>

<p>Von Offenberg, understanding the strength
of the enemy, undertook to give battle. The
first outpost actions were successful for the
Austrians, and helped them in their blunder.
On the 24th of August the two Russian armies
effected a junction, and their Austrian
opponents found themselves threatened with
disaster. An endeavor was made to retreat,
but the retreat turned into a rout. On the
28th Tarnopol was captured by the Russians,
and the Austrian army found itself compelled
to fall back upon defense positions to the south
and east of Lemberg itself.</p>

<p>The attack of the Russian armies was completely
successful. The Austrian army was
driven from its positions, and on September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
4th the Austrians evacuated Lemberg and the
Russian forces took possession of the town.
The Austrians fled. The population welcomed
the conquerors with the greatest enthusiasm.
An immense quantity of stores of
every kind were captured by the Russians together
with at least 100,000 prisoners. There
was no looting, nor any kind of outrage. The
Russian policy was to make friends of the inhabitants
of Galicia.</p>

<p>But there was no halt after Lemberg. Brussilov
divided his army, and sent his left wing
into the Carpathian passes; his center and
right moved west toward Przemysl; while Ruzsky
moved northwest to reinforce the Russian
army on the Bug. Meanwhile the position of
Dankl’s army was perilous in the extreme.
There were two possible courses, one to fall
back and join the remnants of von Offenberg’s
army, the other to attack at once, before the
first Russian army could be reinforced, and if
victorious to turn on Ruzsky.</p>

<p>Dankl’s army was now very strong. He
had received reinforcements, not only from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Austria but from Germany. On the 4th of
September he attacked the Russian center;
his attack was a failure, although he outnumbered
the Russians. The battle continued until
the tenth.</p>

<p>Everywhere the Austrians were beaten, and
driven off in ignominious retreat. The whole
Austrian force fled southward in great disorder;
a part directed its flight toward Przemysl,
others still farther west toward Cracow.
Austria had been completely defeated; except
for a few German detachments near the border,
Poland was clear of the enemy. The
Russian flag flew over Lemberg, while the
Russian army was marching toward Cracow.
The Russian star was in the ascendant.</p>

<p>But the Austrian armies had not been annihilated.
An army of nearly a million men
cannot be destroyed in so short a time. The
Austrian failure was due in part to the disaffection
of some of the elements of the army,
and in part to the poor Austrian generalship.
They had underestimated their foe, and ventured
on a most perilous plan of campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Russian generalship had been most admirable,
and the Russian generals were men of
ability and experience. Brussilov had seen
service in the Turkish War of 1877. Ruzsky
was a professor in the Russian War Academy.
In the Japanese war he had been chief of staff
to General Kaulbars, the commander of the
Second Manchurian army. Associated with
him was General Radko Dmitrieff, an able officer
with a most interesting career. General
Dmitrieff was born in Bulgaria, when it was
a Turkish province. He graduated at the
Military School at Sofia, and afterwards at the
War Academy at Petrograd. On his return
to Bulgaria he commanded a regiment in the
Serbian-Bulgarian war. Later he became
mixed up in the conspiracy against Prince
Alexander, and was forced to leave Bulgaria.
For ten years he served in the Russian army,
returning to Bulgaria on the accession of
Prince Ferdinand. Later on he became Chief
of the General Staff, and when the Balkan
war broke out he commanded one of the Bulgarian
armies, won several important victories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and became a popular hero of the war. Disgusted
with the political squabbles which followed
the war, he returned to Russia as a
general in the Russian army. With men like
these in command, the Russian Empire was
well served.</p>

<p>After the decisive defeat of the Austrian
army under General Dankl, certain changes
were made in the Russian High Command.
General Ruzsky was made commander of the
center, which was largely reinforced. General
Ivanov was put in command of the armies
operating in Galicia with Dmitrieff and Brussilov
as his chief lieutenants. Brussilov’s business
was to seize the deep passes in the Carpathians
and to threaten Hungary. Dmitrieff’s
duty was to press the Austrian retreat,
and capture the main fortresses of central Galicia.</p>

<p>There are two great fortresses on the
River San, Jaroslav and Przemysl, both of
them controlling important railroad routes.
Jaroslav on the main line from Lemberg to
Cracow, Przemysl with a line which skirts the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Carpathians, and connects with lines going
south to Hungary. Jaroslav was fortified by
a strong circle of intrenchments and was looked
to by Austria for stout resistance. The Austrians
were disappointed, for Ivanov captured
it in three days, on the 23d of September.
Dmitrieff found Przemysl a harder nut to
crack. It held out for many months, while
operations of greater importance were being
carried on by the Russian armies. The plans
of the Russian generals in some respects were
not unlike the plan previously suggested as
that of the German High Command. At the
beginning of the war they had no desire to
carry on a powerful offensive against Germany.
The expedition into East Prussia was
conducted more for political than for military
purposes. The real offensive at the start was
to be against Austria. The Russian movements
were cautious at first, but the easy capture
of Lemberg, the fall of Jaroslav, and
the demoralization of the Austrian armies, encouraged
more daring strategy. With the
Germans stopped on the north, little aid to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Austrians could come from that source. The
Grand Duke Nicholas was eager to strike a
great blow before the winter struck in, so his
armies swept to the great Polish city of Cracow.
The campaign against Austria also had
a political side.</p>

<p>Russia had determined upon a new attitude
toward Poland. On August 15th the Grand
Duke Nicholas, on behalf of the Czar, had issued
a proclamation offering self-government
to Russian Poland. Home rule for Poland
had long been a favorite plan with the Czar.
Now he promised, not only to give Russian
Poland home rule, but to add to it the Polish
peoples in Austria and Germany. This meant
that Austria and Germany would have to give
up Galicia on the one hand, and Prussian Poland
on the other, if they should lose the war.
In the old days Poland had been one of the
greatest kingdoms in Europe, with a proud
nobility and high civilization. She was one of
the first of the great Slav peoples to penetrate
the west. Later she had protected Europe
against Tartar invasion, but internal differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
had weakened her, and, surrounded by
enemies, she had first been plundered, and later
on divided between Austria, Russia and Prussia.
Never had the Poles consented to this
destruction of their independence. Galicia
had constantly struggled against Austria;
Prussian Poland was equally disturbing to the
Prussian peace, and Russia was only able to
maintain the control of her Polish province by
the sword. Of the three the Pole was probably
more inclined to keep on friendly terms
with Russia, also a Slav people. The policy
of the Czar encouraged this inclination and
produced disaffection among the Poles in Galicia
and in Posen. Moreover, it gave Russia
the sympathy of the world which had long regarded
the partition of Poland as a political
crime. It encouraged the Czecho-Slavs and
other dissatisfied portions of the Austrian Empire.</p>

<p>The results were seen immediately in the demoralization
of the Austrian armies where
considerable numbers of Czecho-Slovak troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
deserted to the Russian army, and later in the
loyalty to Russia of the Poles, and their refusal,
even under the greatest German pressure,
to give the German Empire aid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<span class="smcap">New Methods and Horrors of Warfare</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Germany embarked upon its policy
of frightfulness, it held in reserve
murderous inventions that had been contributed
to the German General Staff by chemists
and other scientists working in conjunction
with the war. Never since the dawn of time
had there been such a perversion of knowledge
to criminal purposes; never had science contributed
such a deadly toll to the fanatic and
criminal intentions of a war-crazed class.</p>

<p>As the war uncoiled its weary length, and
month after month of embargo and privation
saw the morale of the German nation growing
steadily lower, these murderous inventions were
successively called into play against the Allies,
but as each horror was put into play on the battlefield,
its principles were solved by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
scientists of the Allied nations, and the deadly
engine of destruction was turned with trebled
force against the Huns.</p>

<p>This happened with the various varieties of
poison gas, with liquid fire, with trench knives,
with nail-studded clubs, with armor used by
shock troops, with airplane bombs, with cannon
throwing projectiles weighing thousands
of pounds great distances behind the battle
lines. Not only did America and the Allies
improve upon Germany’s pattern in these respects,
but they added a few inventions that
went far toward turning the scale against Germany.
An example of these is the “tank.”
Originally this was a caterpillar tractor invented
in America and adopted in England.
At first these were of two varieties, the male,
carrying heavy guns only, and the females,
equipped with machine guns. To these was
later added the whippet tank, named after the
racing dog developed in England. These
whippet tanks averaged eighteen miles an hour,
carrying death and terror into the ranks of the
enemy. All the tanks were heavily armored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
and had as their motto the significant words
“Treat ’Em Rough.” The Germans designed
a heavy anti-tank rifle about three feet longer
than the ordinary rifle and carrying a charge
calculated to pierce tank armor. These were
issued to the German first line trenches at the
rate of three to a company. That they were
not particularly effective was proved by the
ease with which the tanks of all varieties tore
through the barbed-wire entanglements and
passed over the Hindenburg and Kriemhild
lines, supposed by the Germans to be impregnable.</p>

<p>The tanks in effect were mobile artillery and
were used as such by all the Allied troops.
Germany frantically endeavored to manufacture
tanks to meet the Allied monsters, but
their efforts were feeble when compared with
the great output opposed to them.</p>

<p>Before considering other inventions used for
the first time in this war, it is well to understand
the tremendous changes in methods and
tactics made necessary by these discoveries.</p>

<p>Put into a sentence, the changed warfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
amounts to this: it is a mobilization of material,
of railroads, great guns, machine guns, food,
airplanes and other engines of destruction quite
as much as it is a mobilization of men.</p>

<p>The Germans won battle after battle at the
beginning of the war because of their system
of strategic railways that made it possible to
transport huge armies to selected points in the
shortest possible time both on the eastern and
the western fronts. Lacking a system of
transportation to match this, Russia lost the
great battles that decided her fate, Belgium
was overrun, and France, once the border was
passed, became a battlefield upon which the
Germans might extend their trench systems
over the face of the land.</p>

<p>Lacking strategic railways to match those of
Germany, France evolved an effective substitute
in the modern system of automobile transportation.
When von Kluck swung aside
from Paris in his first great rush, Gallieni sent
out from Paris an army in taxicabs that struck
the exposed flank and went far toward winning
the first battle of the Marne. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the truck transportation system of the French
along the famous “Sacred Road” back of the
battle line at Verdun that kept inviolate the
motto of the heroic town, “They Shall Not
Pass.” Motor trucks that brought American
reserves in a khaki flood won the second battle
of the Marne. It was the automobile transportation
that enabled Haig to send the British,
Canadians and Australians in full cry after the
retreating Germans when the backbone of the
German resistance was broken before Lens,
Cambrai, and Ostend.</p>

<p>America’s railway transportation system
in France was one of the marvels of the war.
Stretching from the sector of seacoast set apart
for America by the French Government, it
radiated far into the interior, delivering men,
munitions and food in a steady stream.
American engineers worked with their brothers-in-arms
with the Allies to construct an inter-weaving
system of wide-gauge and narrow-gauge
roads that served to victual and munition
the entire front and further serve to deliver
at top speed whole army corps. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
this network of strategic railways that enabled
the French to send an avalanche clad in horizon
blue to the relief of Amiens when Hindenburg
made his final tremendous effort of 1918.</p>

<p>In its essentials, military effort in the great
conflict may be roughly divided into</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Open warfare,</p>

<p>Trench warfare,</p>

<p>Crater warfare.</p>
</div>

<p>The first battle of the Marne was almost
wholly open warfare; so also were the battles of
the Masurian Lakes, Allenstein, and Dunajec
in the eastern theater of war, and most of the
warfare on the Italian front between the Piave
River and Gorizia.</p>

<p>In this variety of battle, airplanes and observation
balloons play a prominent part.
Once the enemy is driven out of its trenches,
the message is flashed by wireless to the artillery
and slaughter at long range begins. If
there have been no intrenchments, as was the
case in the first battle of the Marne, massed artillery
send a plunging fire into the columns
moving in open order and prepare the way for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
machine gunners and infantry to finish the
rout.</p>

<p>In previous wars, cavalry played a heroic
rôle in open warfare; only rarely has it been
possible to use cavalry in the Great War. The
Germans sent a screen of Uhlans before its advancing
hordes into Belgium and Northern
France in 1914. The Uhlans also were in the
van in the Russian invasion, but with these exceptions,
German cavalry was a negligible factor.</p>

<p>British and French cavalry were active in
pursuit of the fleeing Teutons when the Hindenburg
line was smashed in September of
1918. Outside of that brief episode, the cavalry
did comparatively nothing so far as the
Allies were concerned. It was the practice on
both sides to dismount cavalry and convert it
into some form of trench service. Trench
mortar companies, bombing squads, and other
specialty groups were organized from among
the cavalrymen. Of course the fighting in the
open stretches of Mesopotamia, South Africa
and Russia involved the use of great bodies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
cavalry. The trend of modern warfare, however,
is to equip the cavalryman with grenades
and bayonets, in addition to his ordinary gear,
and to make of him practically a mounted
infantryman.</p>

<p>Trench warfare occupied most of the time
and made nine-tenths of the discomforts of the
soldiers of both armies. If proof of the adaptive
capacity of the human animal were needed,
it is afforded by the manner in which the men
burrowed in vermin-infested earth and lived
there under conditions of Arctic cold, frequently
enduring long deprivations of food,
fuel, and suitable clothing. During the early
stages of the war, before men became accustomed
to the rigors of the trenches, many thousands
died as a direct result of the exposure.
Many thousand of others were incapacitated
for life by “trench feet,” a group of maladies
covering the consequences of exposure to cold
and water which in those early days flowed in
rivulets through most of the trenches. The
trenches at Gallipoli had their own special
brand of maladies. Heatstroke and a malarial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
infection were among these disabling agencies.
Trench fever, a malady beginning with a headache
and sometimes ending in partial paralysis
and death, was another common factor in the
mortality records.</p>

<p>But in spite of all these and other discomforts,
in spite of the disgusting vermin that
crawled upon the men both in winter and in
summer, both sides mastered the trenches and
in the end learned to live in them with some degree
of comfort.</p>

<p>At first the trenches were comparatively
straight, shallow affairs; then as the artillery
searched them out, as the machine gunners
learned the art of looping their fire so that the
bullets would drop into the hiding places of
the enemy, the trench systems gradually became
more scientifically involved. After the
Germans had been beaten at the Marne and
had retired to their prepared positions along
the Aisne, there commenced a series of flanking
attempts by one side and the other which
speedily resolved itself into the famous “race to
the sea.” This was a competition between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
opposing armies in rapid trench digging. The
effort on either side was made to prevent the
enemy from executing a flank movement. In
an amazingly short time the opposing trenches
extended from the Belgian coast to the Swiss
border, making further outflanking attempts
impossible of achievement.</p>

<p>This was not the first time in history that intrenched
armies opposed each other. The
Civil War in this country set the fashion in that
respect. The contending sides in the Great
War, however, improved vastly upon the
American example. Communicating trenches
were constructed, leading back to the company
kitchens, and finally to the open road leading
back to the rest billets of the armies.</p>

<p>When night raiding commenced, it was
speedily seen that straight trenches exposed
whole companies of men to enfilading fire.
Thereupon bastions were made and new defenses
presented by zig-zagging the front-line
trenches and the communicating ditches as
well.</p>

<p>To the formidable obstacles presented by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
the trenches, equipped as they were with sandbag
parapets and firing steps, were added
barbed-wire entanglements and pitfalls of
various sorts. The greatest improvement was
made by the Germans, and they added “pill
boxes.” These were really miniature fortresses
of concrete and armor plate with a
dome-shaped roof and loopholes for machine
gunners. Only a direct hit by a projectile
from a big gun served to demolish a “pill box.”
The Allies learned after many costly experiments
that the best method to overcome these
obstacles was to pass over and beyond them,
leaving them isolated in Allied territory, where
they were captured at the leisure of the attackers.</p>

<p>Trench warfare brings with it new instruments.
There are the flame projectors, which
throw fire to a distance of approximately a
hundred feet. The Germans were the first to
use these, but they were excelled in this respect
by the inventive genius of the nations opposing
them.</p>

<p>The use of poison gas, the word being used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
in its broad sense, is now general. It was first
used by the Germans, but as in the case of flame-throwers,
the Allies soon gained the ascendency.</p>

<p>The first use of asphyxiating gas was by the
Germans during the first battle of Ypres.
There the deadly compound was mixed in huge
reservoirs back of the German lines. From
these extended a system of pipes with vents
pointed toward the British and Canadian
lines. Waiting until air currents were moving
steadily westward, the Germans opened the
stop-cocks shortly after midnight and the poisonous
fumes swept slowly, relentlessly forward
in a greenish cloud that moved close to
the earth. The result of that fiendish and cowardly
act was that thousands of men died in
horrible agony without a chance for their
lives.</p>

<p>Besides that first asphyxiating gas, there
soon developed others even more deadly. The
base of most of these was chlorine. Then
came the lachrymatory or “tear-compelling”
gases, calculated to produce temporary or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
permanent blindness. Another German
“triumph” was mustard gas. This is spread in
gas shells, as are all the modern gasses. The
Germans abandoned the cumbersome gas-distributing
system after the invention of the gas
shell. These make a peculiar gobbling sound
as they rush overhead. They explode with a
very slight noise and scatter their contents
broadcast. The liquids carried by them are
usually of the sort that decompose rapidly
when exposed to the air and give off the acrid
gases dreaded by the soldiers. They are directed
against the artillery as well as against
intrenched troops. Every command, no matter
how small, has its warning signal in the
shape of a gong or a siren warning of approaching
gas.</p>

<p>Gas masks were speedily discovered to offset
the dangers of poison gases of all kinds.
These were worn not only by troops in the
field, but by artillery horses, pack mules, liaison
dogs, and by the civilian inhabitants in
back of the battle lines. Where used quickly
and in accordance with instructions, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
masks were a complete protection against attacks by gas.</p>

<p>The perfected gas masks used by both sides
contained a chamber filled with a specially prepared
charcoal. Peach pits were collected by
the millions in all the belligerent countries to
make this charcoal, and other vegetable substances
of similar density were also used.
Anti-gas chemicals were mixed with the charcoal.
The wearer of the mask breathed entirely
through the mouth, gripping a rubber
mouthpiece while his nose was pinched shut by
a clamp attached to the mask.</p>

<p>In training, soldiers were required to hold
their breath for six seconds while the mask was
being adjusted. It was explained to them
that four breaths of the deadly chlorine gas
was sufficient to kill; the first breath produced
a spasm of the glottis; the second brought mental
confusion and delirium; the third produced
unconsciousness; and the fourth death. The
bag containing the gas mask and respirator
was carried always by the soldier.</p>

<p>The soldier during the winter season in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
front-line trenches was a grotesque figure.
His head was crowned with a helmet covered
with khaki because the glint of steel would advertise
his whereabouts. Beneath the helmet
he wore a close fitting woolen cap pulled down
tightly around his ears and sometimes tied or
buttoned beneath his chin. Suspended upon
his chest was the khaki bag containing gas mask
and respirator. Over his outer garments were
his belt, brace straps, bayonet and ammunition
pouches. His rifle was slung upon his
shoulder with the foot of a woolen sock covering
the muzzle and the leg of the same sock
wrapped around the breech. A large jerkin
made of leather, without sleeves, was worn over
the short coat. Long rubber boots reaching to
the hips and strapped at ankle and hip completely
covered his legs. When anticipating
trench raids, or on a raiding party, a handy
trench knife and carefully slung grenades were
added to his equipment.</p>

<p>Airplane bombing ultimately changed the
whole character of the war. It extended the
fighting lines miles behind the battle front. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
brought the horrors of night attacks upon
troops resting in billets. It visited destruction
and death upon the civilian population of cities
scores of miles back of the actual front.</p>

<p>Germany transgressed repeatedly the laws
of humanity by bombing hospitals far behind
the battle front. Describing one of these atrocious
attacks, which took place May 29, 1918,
Colonel G. H. Andrews, Chaplain of a Canadian
regiment, said:</p>

<p>“The building bombed was one of three large
Red Cross hospitals at Boulenes and was filled
with Allied wounded. A hospital in which
were a number of wounded German prisoners
stood not very far away.</p>

<p>“The Germans could not possibly have mistaken
the building they bombed for anything
else but a hospital. There were flags with red
cross flying, and lights were turned on them
so that they would show prominently. And
the windows were brilliantly lighted. Those
inside heard the buzz of the advancing airplanes,
but did not give them a thought.</p>

<p>“The machines came right on, ignoring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
hospital with the German wounded, indicating
they had full knowledge of their objective,
until they were over a wing of the Red Cross
hospital that contained the operating room on
the ground floor. In the operating room a
man was on the table for a most difficult surgical
feat. Around him gathered the staff of
the hospital and its brilliant surgeons. Lieutenant
Sage of New York had just given him
the anaesthetic when one of the airplanes let
the bomb drop. It was a big fellow. It must
have been all of 250 pounds of high explosive.</p>

<p>“It hurtled downward, carrying the two
floors before it. Through the gap thus made
wounded men, the beds in which they lay, convalescents,
and all on the floors came crashing
down to the ground. The bomb’s force extended
itself to wreck the operating room,
where the man on the table, Lieutenant Sage,
and all in the room were killed. In all there
were thirty-seven lives lost, including three
Red Cross nurses.</p>

<p>“The building caught fire. The concussion
had blown the stairs down, so that escape from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
the upper floors seemed impossible. But the
convalescents and the soldiers, who had run to
the scene of the bombing, let the very ill ones
out of the windows, and escape was made in
that way.</p>

<p>“And then to cap the climax, the German
airplanes returned over the spot of their
ghastly triumph and fired on the rescuers with
machine guns. God will never forgive the
Huns for that act alone. Nor will our comrades
ever forget it.”</p>

<p>The statement of Colonel Andrews was corroborated
by a number of other officers.</p>

<p>To protect artillery against counter-fire of
all kinds, both sides from the beginning used
the art of camouflage. This was resorted to
particularly against scouting airplanes. At
first the branches of trees and similar natural
cover were used to deceive the airmen. Later
the guns themselves were painted with protective
colorations, and screens of burlap were
used instead of branches. The camoufleur, as
the camouflage artist was called, speedily extended
his activities to screens over highways,
preventing airmen from seeing troops in motion,
to the protective coloration of lookout
posts, and of other necessary factors along the
fighting front. Camouflage also found great
usefulness in the protective coloration of battle-ships
and merchant vessels. Scientific study
went hand in hand with the art, the object
being to confuse the enemy and to offer targets
as small as possible to the enemy gunners.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MADE-TO-ORDER INFERNO OF THE FLAME-THROWER</p>

<p>A “rain-of-fire” attack in the front-line trenches. This weapon was devised by the Germans and was apparently one of those
pre-war inventions they had counted on to make their conquest easy. It was never as effective a weapon as gas, even when developed
by the Allies, but its terrifying effect can be gauged by the illustration given.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Crater warfare came as a development of intensified
artillery attacks upon trench systems.
It was at Dunajec on the eastern front that for
the first time in modern war the wheels of artillery
were placed hub to hub in intensified hurricane
fire upon enemy positions. The result
there under von Mackensen’s direction was the
rout of the Russians. When later the same tactics
were employed on the western front, the result
was to destroy whole trench systems with
the exception of deep dugouts, and to send the
occupants of the trenches into the craters, made
by shell explosions, for protection.</p>

<p>It was observed that these craters made excellent
cover and when linked by vigorous use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of the intrenching tools carried by every soldier,
they made a fair substitute for the
trenches. This observation gave root to an
idea which was followed by both armies; this
was the deliberate creation of crater systems
by the artillery of the attacking force. Into
these lines of craters the attacking infantry
threw itself in wave after wave as it rushed
toward the enemy trenches. The ground is so
riddled by this intensive artillery fire that there
is created what is known as “moon terrain,”
fields resembling the surface of the moon as
seen through a powerful telescope. Troops on
both sides were trained to utilize these shell
holes to the utmost, each little group occupying
a crater, keeping in touch with its nearest
group and moving steadily in unison toward
the enemy.</p>

<p>One detail in which this war surpassed all
others was in the use of machine guns and grenades.
The Germans were first to make extensive
use of the machine gun as a weapon with
which to produce an effective barrage. They
established machine-gun nests at frequent intervals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
commanding the zone over which infantry
was to advance and by skillful crossfire
kept that terrain free from every living thing.
The Germans preferred a machine gun, water
cooled and of the barrel-recoil type. The
English used a Vickers-Maxim and a Lewis
gun, the latter the invention of an officer in the
American army. The French preferred the
Hotchkiss and the Saint-Etienne. The
Americans standardized the Browning light
and heavy machine guns, and these did effective
service. It was asserted by American gunnery
experts that the Browning excels all other
weapons of its type.</p>

<p>Two general types of grenades were used on
both sides. One a defensive bomb about the
size of an orange, containing a bursting charge
weighing twenty-two ounces. Then there was
a grenade used for offensive work carrying
about thirty-two ounces of high explosives.
The defensive grenades were of cast iron and
so made that they burst into more than a hundred
jagged pieces when they exploded.
These wounded or killed within a radius of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
hundred and fifty yards. In exceptional instances,
the range was higher.</p>

<p>The function of artillery in a modern battle
is constantly extending. Both the big guns
and the howitzers were the deciding factors in
most of the military decisions reached during
the war. Artillery is divided first between the
big guns having a comparatively flat trajectory
and the howitzers whose trajectory is curved.
Then there is a further division into these four
classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Field artillery,</p>

<p>Heavy artillery,</p>

<p>Railroad artillery,</p>

<p>Trench artillery.</p>
</div>

<p>The type of field artillery is the famous 75 millimeter
gun used interchangeably by the
French and Americans. It is a quick-firing
weapon and is used against attacking masses
and for the various kind of barrages, including
an anti-aircraft barrage.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe45_5625" id="i_235">

<p class="caption">TYPES OF LAND BATTLESHIPS DEVELOPED BY ALLIES AND GERMANS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Included in the heavy artillery are guns and
howitzers of larger caliber than the 75 millimeter.
Three distinct and terrifying noises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
accompany explosions of these guns. First,
there is the explosion when the shell leaves the
gun; then there is the peculiar rattling noise
like the passing of a railway train when the
shells pass overhead; then there is the explosion
at point of contact, a terrific concussion which
produces the human condition called “shell
shock,” a derangement of body and brain, paralyzing
nerve and muscle centers and frequently
producing insanity.</p>

<p>The railroad artillery comprises huge guns
pulled on railways by locomotives, each gun
having a number of cars as part of its equipment.
These are slow-firing guns of great
power and hurling the largest projectiles
known to warfare. The largest guns of this
class were produced by American inventive
genius as a reply to the German gun of St.
Gobain Forest. This was a weapon which
hurled a nine-inch shell from a distance of 62
miles into the heart of Paris. The damage
done by it was comparatively slight and it had
no appreciable effect upon the morale of the
Parisians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>Its greatest damage was when it struck the
Roman Catholic Church of St. Gervais on
Good Friday, March 29, 1918, killing seventy-five
persons and wounding ninety. Fifty-four
of those killed were women, five being Americans.
The total effect of the bombardment by
this big gun was to arouse France, England
and America to a fiercer fighting pitch. The
late Cardinal Farley, Archbishop of New
York, expressed this sentiment, when he sent
the following message to the Archbishop of
Paris:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shocked by the brutal killing of innocent victims gathered
at religious services to commemorate the passing of
our blessed Saviour on Good Friday, the Catholics of
New York join your noble protest against this outrage
of the sanctuary on such a day and at such an hour and,
expressing their sympathy to the bereaved relatives of
the dead and injured, pledge their unfaltering allegiance
in support of the common cause that unites our two
great republics. May God bless the brave officers and
men of the allied armies in their splendid defense of
liberty and justice!</p>
</div>

<p>Trench artillery are Stokes guns and other
mortars hurling aerial torpedoes containing
great quantities of high explosives. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
have curved trajectories and are effective not
only against trenches but also against deep
dugouts, wire entanglements and listening
posts.</p>

<p>One of the most important details of modern
warfare is that of communication or liaison on
the battlefield. This is accomplished by runners
recruited from the trenches, by dogs,
pigeons, telephone, radio, signalling lamps,
rockets, but above all by airplanes using radio.
These communications between air and earth
are of course not as exact nor as general by
night as they are by day, but even at night the
airplane plays its important part in liaison.</p>

<p>As has been heretofore stated, the airplane
considered in all its developments, is the newest
and most important of factors in modern warfare.
It photographs the enemy positions, it
detects concentrations and other movements of
the enemy, it makes surprise impossible, it is a
deadly engine of destruction when used in
spraying machine-gun fire upon troops in the
open. As a bombing device, it surpasses the
best and most accurate artillery.</p>
